    # opened via a dynamic ir.actions.server, which meant the URL bar showed a raw
    # "ems.guard_duty_board/<id>" instead of a stable "action-<xmlid>" like every other EMS
    # screen — Odoo can only put a real xmlid in the URL for a *statically declared* action, and
    # a server action that returns a dynamically-built act_window dict has no xmlid of its own to
    # show. Binding to 'ems.course' instead means the board's own screen is a plain
    # ir.actions.client (a real, static, URL-addressable action — see
    # views/attendance/guard_duty_board/menu.xml) with no per-visit record to create/open at all.

        same aggregation idea as ems.group._compute_schedule_attendance_ids
        (models/contacts/group_schedule.py), generalized from "this group" to "the whole centre".
        Deliberately not filtered by 'calendar_id.course_id' — mirrors that same precedent, which
        aggregates the same way without a course filter either: a course-transitioned-out
        calendar/attendance row is archived (active=False, see
        ems_working_schedule_assignation.active's own NOTE), so this plain search() already only
        ever returns the current course's real, active schedules, and stays correct even for a
        legacy calendar whose 'course_id' was never backfilled (added 2026-08-06, not every
        pre-existing row necessarily has it set).

        The explicit 'calendar_id.active' check below is defense-in-depth, not redundant with the
        above: 'ems_working_schedule.action_archive()' now cascades to every remaining attendance
        row when a calendar itself is retired, but this search must not silently start trusting
        that invariant everywhere it's ever established - a calendar could in principle end up
        archived by some other path without its own attendance rows following (found 2026-09-01:
        before that cascade existed, a rolled-over teacher's ARCHIVED calendar kept showing
        active non-teaching rows here indefinitely, since a bare 'active=True' row search never
        looks at its own parent calendar's active state at all)."""
