        Deliberately not filtered by 'calendar_id.course_id' — mirrors that same precedent, which
        aggregates the same way without a course filter either: a course-transitioned-out
        calendar/attendance row is archived (active=False, see

        pre-existing row necessarily has it set).

        The explicit 'calendar_id.active' check below is defense-in-depth, not redundant with the

        row when a calendar itself is retired, but this search must not silently start trusting

        before that cascade existed, a rolled-over teacher's ARCHIVED calendar kept showing

        looks at its own parent calendar's active state at all).

        the first time anything needs 'res.company.resource_calendar_id' and nothing has been

        alone doesn't exclude it, and on a clean install with no real schedules configured yet
        it silently shows up here and corrupts period computation (found 2026-09-08 via CI: the

        that slot, one row per distinct time period (chronological), each with one cell per group
        (teacher(s) + room, or empty) plus the guard-duty teacher(s) for that period. A guard row
        carries no group of its own (see 'non_teaching'), so it's reported separately from the
        group columns instead of as one more column. No per-subject colour is computed here (an
        earlier version reused ems.schedule_report_mixin's REPORT_COLOR_PALETTE the same way the
        teacher/group schedule PDFs do) - removed per developer feedback (2026-09-01): with every
        group already its own column and the subject spelled out as a short acronym in the cell,
        a colour-per-subject wash added visual noise without adding information a plain table
        didn't already convey.

        A period whose hour range is fully absorbed by another period starting at the same time
        (or earlier) never gets a row of its own - see _merge_absorbed_periods() - its cells/
        guards are folded into the row of the period that contains it instead (issue #410).

        A period left with no teaching cell AND no guard after that merge (e.g. a coordination
        duty/meeting nobody's actual class or guard shift overlaps) is dropped entirely - a row
        with nothing in it but a time range adds no information (developer follow-up on #410,
        2026-09-07).

        'level_ids' (issue #390, falsy/omitted = "All levels", the previous, still-default
        behaviour): a list of 'ems.level' ids to narrow the board down to. See "Level filter" in
        docs/en/developers/attendance/guard_duty_board.md for the full design. When set:
        - 'teaching_entries'/'groups'/'periods' only ever come from a group whose own 'level_id'
          (see ems.group's own field) is in 'level_ids' - a "reinforcement" group (no level_id by
          design) can never match. This is the only thing the filter actually controls: which
          time blocks (rows) exist at all.
        - A guard is shown on whichever ROW its own period overlaps, full stop - there is no way
          to know, and no need to know, which level a guard-duty teacher "belongs" to (developer
          feedback, 2026-09-07, after an earlier version tried deriving it from the teacher's own
          other classes that day and got it backwards for a guard who simply doesn't teach
          anything that day - see [[project_guard_duty_board_level_filter]] in memory): once a
          time block is visible for this level (because some class of it runs then), every guard
          on duty then is relevant, regardless of what they otherwise teach.
        - A guard whose own period isn't covered by any of the rows above still gets a shot at a
          dedicated "Patio" row if it falls inside that level's own break period - see
          _get_guard_duty_board_break_lines(). One left over after that simply has no visible
          block to attach to under this level and isn't shown (still visible under "All levels").

        Checking every existing level in the client's own filter dropdown is normalized to the
        same "All levels" (falsy) path below, not treated as a real filter: even with the guard
        rule above, a level-filtered view only ever builds rows from teaching entries (never from
        a guard-only or "reinforcement"-group period the way the unfiltered path's own 'entries'-
        wide 'periods' does) - checking literally every level is meant to mean "show everything",
        indistinguishable from checking none at all.

        `day`, when given, is the concrete date the weekday stands for, and is what adds the
        absence information: every cell gains an 'absences' map of which of its own teachers are
        away, each row gains 'guard_absences' for the same question asked of the guard column,
        and 'absences' - the list of classes actually left without a teacher, which is what the
        board's second tab is built from. Without a date none of that can be resolved at all, so
        every one of those comes back empty and the board is the plain timetable it was before."""
