        already in a group other than 'old_group' is left untouched.

        Reuses plain create()/unlink() instead of writing 'group_id' directly, so the
        existing sync hooks (attendance schedule rosters, open grade session lines) still
        apply exactly as they already do for any other enrollment change. Runs entirely
        with sudo(): by the time this runs, 'student.main_group_id' already points at
        'new_group' (write() calls this AFTER super().write()), so a caller whose own
        access to the student/enrollment came from being the OLD group's tutor
        (rule_contact_tutor/rule_enrollment_tutor, both keyed off the student's CURRENT
        tutor_id) can lose that access mid-transaction the moment the group differs -
        most obviously when the destination group has a different tutor. The group change
        itself was already authorized at the point 'main_group_id' was written; this
        cascade is a system-level consequence of that authorized action, not a separate
        action needing its own re-check - the same reasoning
        _ems_apply_destination_placement() already applies to its own sudo()'d create().
        sudo() only bypasses ACL/record rules, not this method's own Python-level guard:
        unlink()'s scored-grades check still runs and still aborts the whole group change
        with a UserError if a subject already has scored grades in the old group.
