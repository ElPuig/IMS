    # schedule, any subject), a student only ever takes some of a group's subjects, so the search
    # is scoped per enrollment pair, not per group alone — a student enrolled through more than
    # one group (electives, reinforcement) can end up with entries from several groups at once,
    # including genuinely overlapping ones (see the OWL widget's column-split layout). Not stored,
    # same pattern already used for 'ems.group.schedule_attendance_ids'/'enrolled_student_ids'.

    # no model-specific branching needed in the shared JS component (see
    # 'schedule_grid_readonly_field.js's 'bounds' getter) — the same "smuggle a helper field in via

    # empty cache, every time). This @api.depends only matters for the SAME transaction re-reading
    # the field after one of these actually changes (a test's own setUpClass creating enrollments
    # right after the student, an admin editing main_group_id mid-session, ...) - without it nothing
    # tells Odoo to invalidate an earlier, now-stale cached value from before that change (found via
    # TestStudentSchedule's own break-derivation test: setUpClass creates the student, THEN its
    # enrollments, and an unrelated earlier field read on the student had already cached this field
    # as empty in between the two - with no @api.depends, the later enrollments never invalidated it).
