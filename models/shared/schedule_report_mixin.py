# Two hour_from/hour_to values meant to represent the exact same moment can differ by a tiny
# float remainder depending on how each was computed/entered (e.g. a framework's break stored as
# the literal '11.416667' vs a real period's own hour_from computed as '11 + 25/60' ==
# 11.416666666666666) — a strict '<'/'==' comparison would misread that hair's-width gap as a
# real difference. 1/120 hour (30s) safely absorbs that noise without being large enough to treat
# two genuinely distinct, minutes-apart periods as touching. Shared here (not private to one
# model) because both 'hr.employee._get_derived_break_entries' (employees/employee.py) and
# 'ems.course._merge_absorbed_periods' (attendance/guard_duty_board.py) need the exact same
# tolerance for the same kind of comparison.
