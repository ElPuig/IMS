# (ems.course_transition_wizard), never directly by a user. create()/unlink() are already revoked
# in security/ir.model.access.csv for every group on ems.attendance_template, but archiving is a
# plain write() of 'active', which can't be blocked at that same coarse (create/read/write/unlink)
# granularity without also blocking every other legitimate direct field edit (color, etc.).
# ems.attendance_template.write() is the actual enforcement point (see that model); defined here,
# in the shared mixin both models already depend on, so this method's own archive+copy branch
# (used by both models) and every other legitimate internal caller can import one single constant
# without either model needing to import from the other.

# Bottom-up sync redesign (2026-09-08, docs/en/developers/attendance/attendance_template.md's
# "Bottom-up sync redesign" section) - resource.calendar.attendance's own create()/write()/unlink()
# now automatically re-syncs every affected teacher's schedule (hr.employee._ems_sync_schedule_
# from_calendar(), Phase 3) after a relevant change, so no caller needs to remember to do it by
# hand anymore. Default behavior (this flag ABSENT) is "sync" - the safe default, since forgetting
# to think about this at all must never silently reproduce the old, pre-redesign staleness bug.
# The ONLY reason to set this flag is a caller already doing its OWN batched sync across SEVERAL
# teachers at once in one transaction - sync_from_schedule_batch's cross-template
# archive-before-write ordering guarantee (see that method's own docstring: avoiding a false
# room-conflict between two different teachers/templates mid-resync) only holds within ONE batched
# call, not across N separate per-row hook triggers - such a caller sets this around its own
# calendar-writing phase, then runs its own explicit batch sync afterward exactly as before. As of
# Phase 7 (2026-09-08) the only real caller left is the working-schedules import wizard's own
# per-teacher calendar write (_write_teacher_schedule) - course_transition_wizard.py no longer
# suppresses at all (letting the hook fire is the whole point of its own Phase 7 simplification,
# see docs/en/developers/settings/course_transition_wizard.md), and regenerate_all_from_calendars()
# never needed to (it never touches resource.calendar.attendance in the first place).

        and rely on its own 'action_archive()'/'copy()' behavior (e.g. cascading to children) -
        this method only supplies the shared decision, not any model-specific mechanics.

        NOTE: BOTH branches run with the template-lock bypass and sudo() (see
        plans/calendar_driven_attendance_templates.md, point 3, and its 2026-08-11 refinement
        locking most of ems.attendance_template's and ems.attendance_schedule's own fields the same
        way) - required for every legitimate internal caller of this method (the schedule-sync
        pipeline, course_transition_wizard's departing-co-teacher correction, the import wizard's
        room-reassignment resolution) on either model: create()/unlink() are revoked in security/
        ir.model.access.csv, and a direct field write is separately blocked by each model's own
        write() override unless this exact flag is set. Found the hard way (2026-08-11): only the
        archive+copy branch originally carried this bypass - the plain in-place write() branch
        didn't, since it predated the schedule model's own write-lock and the template's own lock
        only covering 'active' at the time this method was first written."""

        exactly this - "lo que manda es el calendario... el aula no es normal que cambie, [pero]

        taking attendance for a session (e.g. an unplanned workshop), so a calendar block's own
        room can legitimately drift from the schedule line's authoritative one over time -
        matching on it, as this lookup originally did, silently breaks the very link it exists to
        find, the moment that drift happens. If more than one line matches (e.g. a stale one left

        decides what to do with each, not this lookup. Extracted as a shared, standalone lookup
        rather than yet another narrowly-scoped inline copy: a full audit (see
