        Installing hr_holidays grants its Administrator group to 'base.default_user', the
        template every new user is copied from, and Odoo propagates that to the existing users
        at install time. On this centre's database that handed all 37 internal users
        'group_hr_holidays_manager' plus, by implication, 'group_hr_holidays_user' and
        'hr.group_hr_user' - so every teacher could read every colleague's absence reason and
        supporting document, which is exactly what the confidentiality rule forbids (see
        docs/en/developers/employees/absence.md), and every employee record besides.

        The rule applied is Odoo's own implication semantics rather than a hardcoded list: a
        user keeps one of these groups only if they hold some *other* group that transitively
        implies it - which, after security/groups.xml, means the Head of Studies chain.

        The one group that cannot come from a chain is 'group_hr_holidays_responsible', the one
        that lets somebody approve. Who approves is not a role anybody holds: it is whoever is
        named as an employee's 'leave_manager_id' (the Area Manager of a top-level department,
        see _compute_leave_manager). Notably that is *not* the whole Secretary group - only the
        ASP area's own manager - so this grants it from that relation instead, which keeps it
        exact and self-maintaining as Area Managers change.

        **Archived users are part of this, 'base.default_user' above all.** That template is
        itself an archived user, and 'res.groups.users' does not return archived ones - so a
        first version of this method left the very record hr_holidays granted the Administrator
        group to untouched, and every user created from then on was born holding it again
        ('res.users._default_groups' copies the template's groups verbatim). The whole recordset
        is therefore read with 'active_test=False', which also covers former staff: an archived
        employee who comes back gets their groups from the role hierarchy
        ('hr.employee._sync_security_groups'), not from what was left on their old account.
