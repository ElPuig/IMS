        the user still holds also implies them.

        Odoo's own implied-group mechanism (GroupsImplied.write) is grant-only
        and never revokes; this compensates for that specifically within the
        EMS-managed group set. It intentionally does NOT touch external groups

        held - there is no way to distinguish that case from an EMS-implied
        grant once both are rows in res_groups_users_rel; this is an accepted,
        documented limitation.

        Only the *direct* implied_ids declared on the removed EMS group(s) are
        considered - not their full transitive closure. Groups like
        `sales_team.group_sale_salesman_all_leads` (one of Secretary's direct

        groups (e.g. `base.group_user` "Internal User") that are not specific

        their EMS role; chasing the full transitive closure would revoke
        those too and could effectively lock a user out. Staying at depth 1
