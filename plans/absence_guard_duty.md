# Guard duty: covering the lessons an absence leaves uncovered

**Status: partly implemented as of 2026-09-08.** Split out of `plans/absence_management.md` when
the absence feature itself landed (branch `376-absence-management`); everything else in that plan
is implemented and documented in `docs/en/developers/employees/absence.md`.

**What has since been built (2026-09-08), and is no longer part of this plan:** the *read-only*
half — showing which lessons an absence leaves uncovered, so a human can assign the guards. The
guard duty board grew a week/date picker and a second view ("Guard duty table": one row per time
block, absences against the teachers on guard), and marks absent teachers in place on the
timetable itself. See `docs/en/developers/attendance/guard_duty_board.md`'s "Absences on the
board" section — that, not this file, is now authoritative for anything already shipped.

Note it was built off `resource.calendar.attendance` (the teacher's own working schedule, which
is what the board has always aggregated and where guard-duty slots actually live via
`non_teaching_is_guard`), **not** off `ems.attendance_schedule` as the resolver sketched below
assumes. Anything reused from this file has to be re-pointed accordingly.

**Still deferred deliberately, not abandoned:** the *deciding* half — automatically assigning
which of the several teachers on guard in a period covers a given absence, and notifying them.
Nothing at the centre decides that yet, so there is still no way to say who a notification should
even go to. Tracked as issue #307 (Automatic guard assignation), with #148 (a guard teacher
checking in for a colleague) alongside it.

### What the exploration found, which invalidates the first sketch

- **Attendance sessions do not exist in advance.** An `ems.attendance_session_header` is created
  when somebody opens that lesson to take attendance
  (`ems.attendance_session_header.create_scheduled_session`). For a future absence there is
  nothing to flag, so the original idea of flipping affected sessions to `mode = 'guard'` cannot
  work. The state has to be derived at read time instead.
- **A guard mode already exists.** `get_guard_sessions(date)` and `get_guard_planned(date)` show
  a guard teacher everything happening that day that is not theirs - both already keyed by a
  concrete date. What is missing is only the distinction between "not my class" and "this class
  has no teacher today".
- The **guard duty board** (`models/attendance/guard_duty_board.py`) is weekday-based, with no
  concrete date, so surfacing absences there needs a date picker added first - a JS change to a
  screen already in use. The date-based guard screen is the cheaper and more natural home.

### The resolver, written and tested, then lifted out

Built and green against the real models, then removed from the module rather than shipped
unused. Drop it back into `models/employees/absence.py` (on `hr.leave`) and
`tests/test_absence.py` when the issue is picked up.

```python
    # --- Guard duty -------------------------------------------------------------------------

    def _ems_affected_schedules(self):
        """The lessons this absence leaves uncovered, as {date: ems.attendance_schedule}.

        Resolved on demand rather than written anywhere, because there is nothing to write to:
        an 'ems.attendance_session_header' only comes into existence when somebody opens that
        lesson to take attendance (see create_scheduled_session), so for a future absence the
        sessions simply do not exist yet. Guard mode already asks the same question of a date
        (get_guard_planned) - this answers which of those answers are uncovered rather than
        merely someone else's.

        Only approved absences count: a request still pending is not yet a reason for anyone to
        cover a class. sudo() because a guard teacher legitimately needs to see schedules that
        are not theirs, the same justification get_guard_sessions() carries.

Its tests, which pin the rules worth keeping - a whole-day absence uncovers every lesson, a
partial one only what it overlaps (arriving an hour late leaves the afternoon alone), and a
request still pending uncovers nothing:

```

The test fixture needs `create_level_study_group` from `tests/common.py`, and a space built with
`ems.space_type_classroom` / `ems.work_location_main` - `ems.space` requires both.
