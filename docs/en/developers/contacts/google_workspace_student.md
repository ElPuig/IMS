# Google Workspace student integration

Automates the corporate Google Workspace account every student needs, created through
the Admin SDK Directory API; the resulting address is stored in `student_email`. Unlike
the staff sibling (below), students never get a separate `res.users` — there is no EMS
login/OAuth-linking step here, so this file is noticeably smaller.

Lives in `models/contacts/google_workspace_integration.py` (`ResPartnerGoogleWorkspace`,
`_inherit = 'res.partner'`), with shared helpers in
[`google.workspace.mixin`](../shared/google_workspace_mixin.md).
See [Google Workspace staff integration](../employees/google_workspace_staff.md) for the
teacher/ASP sibling — same shared mixin, same overall shape, different account population
and no EMS-user step.

## Flow

```mermaid

    participant U as Secretary/Admin (or automatic)

    P->>P: _gw_enqueue_if_ready()
    alt missing IDALU / names / personal email
        Note over P: no chatter note posted (unlike staff) — GEDAC\nimport usually supplies this already
    else ready
        P->>Q: with_delay(action_create_google_account)
        Q->>G: users().insert(primaryEmail=candidate, orgUnitPath=minor/adult OU)
        G-->>Q: 200 (409 → next candidate)
        Q->>P: student_email = chosen address
        Q->>P: _gw_deliver_credentials() (PDF into ems.student.document + welcome mail)
    end
```

### Email candidate strategy — `_gw_email_candidates`

Ordered, IDALU/birth-year-based (no separate "suggested login" field like staff's
`google_ws_login` — students have no equivalent field to seed one):

```
Juan Morote Puente, born 2006, IDALU 123456789
1. jmorote         initial(firstname) + surname1
2. jmorotep        + initial(surname2)
3. jmorotep06      base + last 2 digits of birth year
4. jmorotep89      base + last 2 digits of IDALU
5. jmorotep6789    base + last 4 digits of IDALU
```

Existence in Google is resolved by trying `users().insert()` and reacting to a `409`
conflict (try the next candidate) rather than a pre-check `users().get()` — a role scoped
to the students OU gets `403`, not `404`, for a non-existent user, so `get()` cannot
reliably tell "free" from "not authorized." `_gw_email_used_in_ems` additionally excludes
any candidate already claimed by another student record in EMS itself.

## Minor / adult OU placement

The one piece of logic with **no staff equivalent** (staff branches on `employee_type`
instead): every account-touching action re-derives the target OU from `is_adult`
(`res.partner`'s own compute, from `birth_date`) at the moment it runs:

```python
ou = company.google_ws_ou_adult if self.is_adult else company.google_ws_ou_minor
```

`birth_date` is **deliberately not** in `_gw_missing_fields()` — the account must be
created as soon as the student is admitted (matriculation), even from GEDAC data that has
no birth date yet. Without it, `is_adult` is `False` and the student starts in the minors
OU. **`action_relocate_google_account`** is the catch-up step: triggered by
`contact.py`'s `write()` whenever `birth_date` changes (`_gw_enqueue_relocate`), it
re-derives the OU and `users().patch()`es it — a no-op on Google's side if the OU turns
out unchanged. Skips suspended accounts (they live in the suspended OU; reactivation
re-derives the correct one instead). There is no manual button for this — it is
queue-job-only, same as the staff doc notes for its own internal-only steps.

**Bug found and fixed in this pass (2026-07-28):** `action_relocate_google_account` called
`self._gw_get_service()` directly — a method that does not exist on this model (it lives
on the `google.workspace.mixin`, reached everywhere else via `self._gw()._gw_get_service()`).
This raised `AttributeError` on every real (non-dry-run) relocation, i.e. whenever a
student's birth date arrived after account creation and actually needed to move them out
of the minors OU. Masked in practice because dry-run mode returns before reaching that
line, and no test previously exercised the non-dry-run path. Fixed, with a regression test
(`test_relocate_uses_shared_gw_helper`) that forces `google_ws_dry_run = False` and mocks
`GoogleWorkspaceMixin._gw_get_service` directly — the dry-run-only testing habit inherited
from the staff suite cannot catch this class of bug, worth remembering for any future
method added to either integration.

## Lifecycle

Archiving a student does **not** touch the Google account straight away. It opens a
two-stage grace period (issue #388) driven by two date fields on the partner and a daily
cron, so a student who leaves and comes back within the month never loses anything, and
nobody is deactivated without having been told first:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Archived / withdrawal / graduation] -->|warning email + chatter| B[google_ws_deactivation_date = today + 30]
    B -->|daily cron, date reached| C[Account suspended, moved to the suspended OU]
    C --> D[google_ws_deletion_date = today + 30]
    D -->|daily cron, date reached| E[Account deleted in Google]
    B -->|unarchived| F[Schedule cancelled, nothing ever changed in Google]
    C -->|unarchived| G[Reactivated]
    E -->|unarchived| H[Recreated from scratch]
```

| Student event | Google account |
|---|---|
| Admitted / data completed (ready) | created (queued), OU by current `is_adult` |
| `birth_date` arrives/changes | relocated to the OU matching the new `is_adult` (queued) |
| Archived / withdrawal / graduation conversion | **nothing yet**: `google_ws_deactivation_date` set to today + `GW_DEACTIVATION_DELAY_DAYS`, warning email sent, chatter note posted |
| Deactivation date reached (daily cron) | suspended, moved to the suspended OU (queued); `google_ws_deletion_date` set to today + `GW_DELETION_DELAY_DAYS` |
| Deletion date reached (daily cron) | **deleted** in Google (queued); `google_ws_deleted = True`, `student_email` kept for traceability |
| Unarchived before the deactivation date | schedule cancelled, chatter note; the account was never touched |
| Unarchived while suspended | reactivated (queued), deletion schedule cancelled |
| Unarchived after deletion | recreated from scratch (new credentials; the same address again if it is still free, the next candidate if Google still holds it) |
| Deleted (`unlink`) | suspended **synchronously**, before the record disappears |

The delays are fixed constants in `models/shared/google_workspace_mixin.py`
(`GW_DEACTIVATION_DELAY_DAYS`, `GW_DELETION_DELAY_DAYS`, both 30) rather than company
settings: the centre's policy is the one written in the issue, and a per-centre knob would
only add a way to get it wrong.

### The daily cron

`ems.ir_cron_gw_student_lifecycle` (`data/main/ir_cron_google_workspace.csv`) runs
`res.partner._gw_cron_process_lifecycle()` once a day. It does no Google API call itself:
it only finds the partners whose scheduled date has arrived and enqueues the existing
`action_suspend_google_account` / `action_delete_google_account` jobs, so a slow or failing
Directory API call never blocks the cron.

```python
# suspension due: archived students whose deactivation date has arrived
[('active', '=', False), ('google_ws_deactivation_date', '<=', today),
 ('google_ws_suspended', '=', False), ('student_email', '!=', False)]
# deletion due: already suspended, deletion date arrived, not deleted yet
[('active', '=', False), ('google_ws_deletion_date', '<=', today),
 ('google_ws_suspended', '=', True), ('google_ws_deleted', '=', False)]
```

Both searches use `active_test=False` — every record they look for is archived by
definition.

### Deletion is irreversible, and only for new departures

`action_delete_google_account()` calls `users().delete()` on the Directory API: the mailbox
and Drive content are gone. Three guards keep it narrow:

- It only ever runs from a `google_ws_deletion_date` that `action_suspend_google_account()`
  itself set — i.e. an account that went through the full warned-and-suspended path.
- Students already suspended before this feature existed have no
  `google_ws_deletion_date`, and the migration deliberately does **not** backfill one: they
  stay suspended forever, exactly as they are today. Only departures from now on get a
  deletion date.
- `google_ws_deleted` makes it idempotent, and `student_email` is deliberately **kept** on
  the record after deletion, so the address is still seen as taken by
  `_gw_email_used_in_ems()` and never handed to a different student.

### `unlink()` keeps suspending synchronously

The `unlink()` override still suspends immediately instead of scheduling, and deliberately
so: a hard delete leaves no record to hold `google_ws_deactivation_date`, so there would be
nothing for the cron to find. A hard delete is also not the archive/withdrawal path the
grace period is about — it is an administrative removal of the record itself. Runs
`action_suspend_google_account()` synchronously (not queued) since the partner — and its
`student_email` — will not exist once `unlink()` returns; a failure is logged, not raised,
so it never blocks the actual deletion.

### The warning email

`ems.mail_template_google_deactivation_student`
(`data/main/mail.template-google_lifecycle.csv`) is sent once, when the schedule is
created, to **both** the personal address (`email`) and the corporate one
(`student_email`): the corporate mailbox is still alive during the grace period, and it is
the one the student actually reads day to day. It states both dates — deactivation and
deletion — as the issue requires. A student with neither address gets the chatter note
only.

## `google_ws_state`

Same single-source-of-truth pattern as the staff side, but only **3** states (no
`manual_pending`/`pending_user` — those exist only because staff has a separate EMS-user
step):

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> none: not a student, or no student_email
    none --> active: account created
    active --> suspended: action_suspend_google_account()
    suspended --> active: action_reactivate_google_account()
```

| `google_ws_state` | Header button shown (`views/community/contact/form.xml`) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | Create Google account | Not a student, or no corporate email yet |
| `active` | Suspend Google account | Fully set up |
| `suspended` | Reactivate Google account | `google_ws_suspended = True` |

The same one-off migration as the staff side (`migrations/18.0.0.22.0/post-migrate.py`,
`_backfill_google_ws_suspended`) backfills `google_ws_suspended = True` for students
already archived/withdrawn before the field existed.

## Access control

`rule_contact_teacher` (`security/rules/contacts.xml`) gives `ems.group_teacher` **read
access to every `res.partner`, unrestricted** (`domain_force = []`). Anything about the
Google account that appears on the student form is therefore visible to any teacher unless
it carries its own `groups`, which is why the grace-period banners, the optional list
columns and the search filters all repeat the same groups as the buttons they belong to:
whoever cannot act on the account has no business reading its schedule either. Regression
tests: `test_schedule_is_hidden_from_teachers` / `test_schedule_is_visible_to_the_secretary`
/ `test_search_filters_are_hidden_from_teachers`, which assert on the arch actually
returned by `get_view()` per user.

This is a view-level restriction, not a field-level one: the fields themselves carry no
`groups=`, so they stay readable over RPC by anyone who can read the partner. That was a
deliberate call (the data is an administrative date, not personal data about the student);
tightening it would mean putting `groups=` on the field definitions and re-checking every
write path.

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Header buttons (create/suspend/reactivate/delete/cancel) | `ems.group_secretary`, `ems.group_academic_admin` |
| Grace-period banners, optional list columns, search filters | same as above |
| `_gw_deliver_credentials`'s document/email creation | `sudo()` inside the flow (queue jobs run as the job's own user, not necessarily one with `ems.student.document`/mail rights) |

## Required fields

| Step | Required data |
|---|---|
| Google account creation | `firstname`, `lastname`, `student_id` (IDALU), `email` (personal, used for recovery + credential delivery) — `birth_date` deliberately **not** required, see above |

## Tests

`tests/test_student_google_workspace.py` (`TestStudentGoogleWorkspace`) — readiness,
email-candidate strategy, creation (dry-run, both OUs, idempotence, missing-data
`UserError`), suspend/reactivate (dry-run, idempotence), relocate (dry-run, the
suspended-account skip, and the non-dry-run regression test for the bug above), and
`unlink()`. `google_ws_state` for all 3 states and the `google_ws_suspended` migration
backfill are already covered by `tests/test_exit_management.py` (not duplicated here — see
that file's `test_gw_*`/`test_migration_backfills_suspended_for_alumni_and_withdrawal`).
`tests/test_student_google_workspace.py` also carries
`TestStudentGoogleWorkspaceLifecycle` for the grace period (#388): scheduling on archive,
the warning email, cancelling, the deletion schedule set by the suspension and cancelled
by the reactivation, `action_delete_google_account` (dry-run, the real `users().delete()`
call, idempotence, the not-suspended guard, the address staying reserved), recreation
after deletion, and both cron stages - including the check that a student suspended
before this feature existed, with no `google_ws_deletion_date`, is never deleted.

`tests/test_student_google_workspace_tour.py` (`TestStudentGoogleWorkspaceTour`) renders
the two banners and their buttons in a real browser: they are driven by the date fields
rather than by `google_ws_state`, so no state test covers them. It relies on
`ems.action_student_kanban` running with `active_test` disabled, which is what keeps
archived students reachable from their own menu.
