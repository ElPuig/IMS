# Google Workspace staff integration & EMS user auto-creation

Automates the two accounts every staff member (teacher / ASP) needs:

1. **Corporate Google Workspace account** (issue 304) — created through the Admin SDK
   Directory API; the resulting address is stored in `work_email`.
2. **EMS user** (`res.users`, issue 342) — created right after the Google account, with
   login = corporate email and Google OAuth **pre-linked** (`oauth_uid` = the numeric
   Google user id returned by the Directory API), so staff sign in with the
   *Sign in with Google* button without ever receiving a password email.

Both live in `models/employees/google_workspace_integration.py`
(`HrEmployeeGoogleWorkspace`, `_inherit = 'hr.employee'`), with shared helpers in
[`google.workspace.mixin`](../shared/google_workspace_mixin.md).

```

### `_ems_create_user(google_id=False)`

Idempotent; everything runs `sudo()` (callers are queue jobs or buttons limited to
`ems.group_academic_admin` / `hr.group_hr_user`). In order:

1. Guard: `employee_type in ('teacher', 'asp')` and `work_email` ends with the
   corporate domain — otherwise no-op.
2. Employee already has `user_id` → only backfill the OAuth fields if empty
   (and the `(provider, oauth_uid)` pair is free).
3. A `res.users` with `login = work_email` exists (archived included) and is not
   linked to another employee → re-link: unarchive, realign `login`/`email` to the
   corporate address, add missing groups, backfill OAuth. Linked to another
   employee → skip with a chatter note.
4. Otherwise create the user: `login`/`email` = corporate address (load-bearing —
   see *pitfalls*), `firstname`/`lastname` from `_gw_split_name()` (res.users
   inherits res.partner, which uses OCA `partner_firstname`), `mobile`, `tz`,
   explicit `company_id`/`company_ids` and groups, all under
   `no_reset_password=True`.
5. `_ems_link_google_signin(user, google_id)` sets `oauth_uid` + `oauth_provider_id`
   when the id is known and not taken by another user (auth_oauth unique constraint).
6. Link `employee.user_id`, call `_sync_security_groups()` so role/job-mapped
   groups apply immediately (the `write()` trigger only fires on
   `role_ids`/`job_id`/`tutorship_ids`), and post a chatter summary
   (created/re-linked + whether Google sign-in was pre-linked).

Call sites inside `action_create_google_account()`:

- **Success path** — right after `work_email` is written, before
  `_gw_deliver_credentials()`, with the `id` from the `users().insert` response.
- **Adopt path** (employee already had a corporate `work_email`, e.g. manual email or
  data migrated from before the integration) — delegates to `action_create_ems_user()`
  (below) instead of calling `_ems_create_user` inline, so the same code runs whether
  it is reached automatically or by the user pressing the dedicated button.

### `action_create_ems_user()`

Public action (no Google API call): `_ems_create_user(google_id=self._gw_google_user_id())`,
guarded by the same `employee_type`/`work_email` checks. This is the header button shown
in the `pending_user` state (below) — a corporate account already exists but no `res.users`
is linked yet — and it is what `action_create_google_account()`'s adopt path now calls
internally, so there is a single implementation either way.

In **dry-run** (`company.google_ws_dry_run`) no API call is made, so there is no
Google id: the EMS user is created without OAuth fields.

### `action_relink_google_signin()`

Repairs "Sign in with Google" for an employee who **already has** an EMS user whose
OAuth fields were lost (`oauth_uid` / `oauth_provider_id` emptied by hand, by a bad
import, or by a partial restore). Without them the user cannot log in at all:
`auth_oauth` matches an incoming login exclusively by `(oauth_uid,
oauth_provider_id)`, and its fallback path (`signup`) fails because the login already
exists — so Google answers correctly and Odoo still returns *Access Denied*. There is
no e-mail-based fallback.

The action resolves the numeric Google id through the Directory API
(`_gw_google_user_id(raise_on_error=True)`) and hands it to the same
`_ems_link_google_signin()` used by the creation paths, so there is one implementation
of the link itself. It never overwrites a link that is already there — the button is
hidden in that case — and it never touches the Google account.

Unlike the automatic paths, every failure is raised instead of swallowed: pressing a
button and getting no feedback is worse than an error message. `_gw_google_user_id()`
therefore takes a `raise_on_error` flag (default `False`, preserving the silent
behaviour the queue jobs rely on) and, when set, reports dry-run and API failure as
distinct errors. It deliberately does **not** try to tell "no such account" from
"account outside my scope": the service-account role is scoped to the managed OUs and
Google answers **403, not 404**, for anything outside them, so the two are not
reliably distinguishable from the response — the message names both causes instead. A
`oauth_uid` already claimed
by a different `res.users` (the `auth_oauth` unique constraint) is reported naming
that user, since the fix there is to clear the stale record first.

## Lifecycle

| Employee event | Google account | EMS user (`res.users`) |
|---|---|---|
| Created / completed (ready) | created (queued) | created + OAuth pre-linked |
| Archived (`active = False`) | suspended, moved to suspended OU (queued) | archived immediately (`_ems_sync_user_active`) |
| Unarchived | reactivated (queued) | unarchived |
| Deleted (`unlink`) | suspended synchronously | archived |

The user archiving is deliberately **synchronous and independent** of
`google_ws_enabled` and of the job queue: a former employee must lose Odoo access
immediately even if the Google integration is disabled or the queue is down.
`_ems_sync_user_active` skips `self.env.user` and the superuser.

## Header button state (`google_ws_state`)

The employee form (`views/community/employee/form.xml`) shows at most **one** of four
mutually-exclusive header buttons, driven entirely by one computed, stored `Selection`
field — `google_ws_state` — instead of each button evaluating its own combination of
`work_email`/`user_id`/`google_ws_suspended`/`google_ws_manual_email`. This replaced an
earlier version where two independently-computed `invisible` expressions could disagree
and show two buttons at once for a teacher whose account was adopted from
pre-integration/migrated data (`work_email` set, `user_id` not yet linked) — the bug that
motivated the consolidation.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> none: not teacher/asp
    none --> manual_pending: google_ws_manual_email ticked
    none --> pending_user: work_email set, no user_id\n(adopt / migration gap)
    manual_pending --> pending_user: work_email filled in manually
    none --> active: action_create_google_account()\n(work_email + user_id both set)
    pending_user --> active: action_create_ems_user()
    active --> suspended: action_suspend_google_account()
    suspended --> active: action_reactivate_google_account()
```

| `google_ws_state` | Header button shown | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | Create Google account | No corporate email yet |
| `manual_pending` | *(none)* | `google_ws_manual_email` ticked, waiting for the email to be typed in |
| `pending_user` | Create EMS User | Corporate email exists, no `res.users` linked (adopt / migration gap) |
| `active` | Suspend Google account (+ Re-link Google sign-in when `google_signin_missing`) | Fully set up |
| `suspended` | Reactivate Google account | `google_ws_suspended = True` |

The one button that is **not** part of that mutually-exclusive set is **Re-link Google
sign-in**, driven by its own non-stored computed boolean, `google_signin_missing`
(`google_ws_state == 'active'` and the linked user has no `oauth_uid`). It is a repair
offered *alongside* Suspend rather than another state of its own: the account is
genuinely active and fully set up, only the sign-in link is broken, so hiding Suspend
while it shows would misrepresent the account. The compute reads `user_id.oauth_uid`
through `sudo()` — an `hr.group_hr_user` who is not an Odoo administrator cannot read
`res.users` OAuth fields, and the button must still render for them.

`res.partner` (students) has the analogous `google_ws_state` in
`models/contacts/google_workspace_integration.py` — see
[Google Workspace student integration](../contacts/google_workspace_student.md) — with
only three values (`none` / `active` / `suspended` — students never get a `pending_user`
state since account creation there never involves a separate `res.users`).

A one-off migration (`migrations/18.0.0.22.0/post-migrate.py`,
`_backfill_google_ws_suspended`) marks `google_ws_suspended = True` for employees/students
that were already archived/withdrawn before the field existed (added in 18.0.0.19.0 /
18.0.0.19.2), so they land in `suspended` instead of the wrong `active` state.

## Access control

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Create employee / trigger account creation (buttons, incl. `action_create_ems_user`) | `ems.group_academic_admin`, `hr.group_hr_user` |
| Auto-created user groups (teacher) | `base.group_user` + `ems.group_teacher` |
| Auto-created user groups (ASP) | `base.group_user` only (role/job sync adds the rest) |
| res.users creation itself | `sudo()` inside the flow |

`ems.group_teacher` does **not** imply `base.group_user`, so the internal-user group
is granted explicitly.

## Required fields

| Step | Required data |
|---|---|
| Plain employee creation | `name` (plus `private_email` at view level for **new** teacher/ASP records) |
| Google account creation | `name`, `private_email` (recovery + credentials email); phone/NIF optional |
| EMS user creation | corporate `work_email` (produced by the previous step) |

## Interplay with pending-identification placeholders

A teacher created by the working-schedule importer from a not-yet-staffed post's code
(`hr.employee.schedule_import_code` set, `pending_identification` computed `True` — see
`docs/en/developers/employees/working_schedule.md`'s "Pending-identification teachers"
section) is just a normal `employee_type='teacher'` record with `name`/`private_email`
still blank. `_gw_missing_fields()` already requires both, so `action_create_google_account()`
raises its existing `UserError` for a still-unidentified placeholder exactly like it would
for any other incomplete employee — **no special-casing was needed for this integration
itself.**

The clearing itself lives in `_ems_create_user()`'s shared helper, `_gw_clear_pending_identification()`
— called once a real `res.users` is actually linked, right after `emp.write({'user_id': user.id})`.
It posts a chatter note naming the original code, then clears the field
(`emp.write({'schedule_import_code': False})`). Since `_ems_create_user()` is the single method
both `action_create_google_account()` (full creation) and `action_create_ems_user()` (adopt an
existing corporate account) end up calling, this is what lets an admin's normal flow — open the
placeholder record, fill in the real `name` + `private_email`, click **Generate Google account**
(or, for the adopt path, **Create EMS User**) — double as the "confirm this teacher's real
identity" step, with no separate action needed. The schedule/`ems.teaching`/`ems.attendance_template`
rows created at import time are untouched; they were already attached to this same `hr.employee` id.

**Bug fixed while investigating #378 (2026-09-01):** this used to live as a few lines at the very
end of `action_create_google_account()`'s success path only — the adopt branch (`work_email`
already corporate) returned via `action_create_ems_user()` *before* ever reaching that code, so a
pending teacher whose corporate account already existed (adopted, not freshly created) stayed
stuck "pending" forever even after getting a working EMS login. Moving the clear into
`_ems_create_user()` itself (the one place both callers converge on) fixes both paths at once.

For a pending teacher that will genuinely never get an account through this record at all (e.g.
duplicate/unmerged employee, or the post never ends up needing one), `hr.employee.action_mark_as_identified()`
(`models/employees/employee.py`) is a manual, standalone escape hatch: it just clears
`schedule_import_code` (with the same chatter note) and does nothing else — no Google API call, no
`res.users` creation. Exposed as the **Mark as identified** header button
(`views/community/employee/form.xml`), visible only while `pending_identification` is `True`,
behind a `confirm=` dialog since it can't be undone (the original placeholder code is gone once
cleared, so this is a one-way action, not a toggle).

## Pitfalls (native hr v18)

- `work_email` is a stored compute on `work_contact_id.email`, and writing
  `user_id` swaps `work_contact_id` to the user's partner (`_sync_user`). Creating
  the user **without `email`** would wipe the just-written corporate address.
  Same for `mobile_phone` → pass `mobile` in the create values.
- With `email` set, `auth_signup` sends the invitation mail on user creation unless
  `no_reset_password=True` is in the context.
- Re-entrancy is safe: linking `user_id` re-enters `write()` but `_gw_ready()` is
  `False` once `work_email` is set.

## Tests

`tests/test_employee_ems_user.py` (`TestEmployeeEmsUser`) — user creation, groups per
type, OAuth capture/backfill, idempotence, re-link of archived users, `work_email`
survival regression, lifecycle sync, no invitation mail, and `action_create_ems_user`
(links the user without touching the Google API, idempotent, no-op without
`work_email`). The SMTP transport is patched class-wide (see `tests/test_strike.py`
pattern). Google-side behaviour, the `google_ws_state` compute for every state, and the
`google_ws_suspended` migration backfill are covered by
`tests/test_employee_google_workspace.py`; the analogous student-side `google_ws_state`
and backfill tests live in `tests/test_exit_management.py`.
`tests/test_employee_google_workspace_tour.py` +
`static/tests/tours/employee_google_workspace_tour.js` open the employee form in a real
browser for each state and assert exactly one header button renders — the client-side
render that a `TransactionCase` cannot exercise. The student-side integration has its own
`tests/test_student_google_workspace.py` — see
[Google Workspace student integration](../contacts/google_workspace_student.md#tests).
