# Teacher Roles and Permission Levels

Teachers gain elevated access by being assigned a **role**. Each role that carries a permission level automatically grants the corresponding security group to the teacher's user account — there is no need to edit user permissions directly.

**Required role:** Administrator

---

## Permission Levels

Permission levels form a hierarchy — each level includes all the permissions of the ones before it:

**Teacher → Tutor → Department Chief → Head of Studies → Director → Administrator**

| Role | Permission level granted | How it is assigned |
|------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| *(none)* | Teacher | Default for every teacher |
| Tutor | Tutor | Automatic — set when the teacher is assigned as the tutor of a Class Group |
| Department chieff | Department Chief | Automatic — set as **Department Chief** on the department's own form |
| Seminar leader | Department Chief | Automatic — set as **Seminar Chief** on the department's own form |
| Head of studies / Deputy head of studies | Head of Studies | Automatic — set as **Area Manager** on a top-level department's own form (Role = Head of studies/Deputy) |
| Secretary | *(Secretary block — see note below)* | Automatic — set as **Area Manager** on the `ASP` department's own form (Role = Secretary) |
| Director | Director | Automatic — set as **Director** in Settings > EMS Management |
| TAC coordinator | *(TAC block — see note below)* | Manual — added to the **Roles** field on the teacher's own record |

> Department Chief currently grants the same permissions as Tutor, plus the ability to create, edit and delete Class Groups (Contacts → Groups). It exists as its own level so it can be extended independently in the future. Seminar leader is granted the same permission level.
>
> **Secretary is not part of this ladder.** It grants access to a completely separate permission block (Secretary: Manager/Administrator), unrelated to the Teacher→...→Director chain above — even though it's configured the same way (as an "Area Manager" on a top-level department's form), it does not sit at any particular rung of this ladder.
>
> **TAC coordinator is not part of this ladder either.** It grants its own separate permission block (TAC: Manager/Administrator), and unlike every other role in this table it is assigned by hand, from the teacher's own **Roles** field. It grants exactly one thing: the ability to create and edit teacher records in full, private information included — the same right the Head of Studies gained, and nothing else from the ladder above. It is not unipersonal: the post can be held by a team of several teachers at once.
>
> **Head of Studies, Deputy and Director can now create and edit teachers.** Until recently only the Administrator could; see [Creating and Editing Teachers](../head_of_studies/staff-management.md). Deleting a staff record and managing ASP staff both remain exclusive to the Administrator.

## Access

Navigate to: **Employees → [open the teacher's record]**

---

## Customizing a Role's Color

Each role in the catalog has a color, shown as a badge wherever a teacher's roles are displayed (their employee form, the employee kanban card). To change it:

1. Navigate to **Educational Community → Configuration → Teachers → Roles** (or **→ ASP → Roles** for ASP staff roles).
2. Open the role and click its color swatch — pick any color you like, there is no fixed list to choose from.
3. Click **Save**.

The badge automatically shows the color you picked with readable text, whatever shade you choose.

---

## Assign a Role

1. Open the teacher's employee record.
2. In the **Roles** field, add the role that matches the permission level to grant (e.g. **Department chieff**).
3. Click **Save** (or navigate away — Odoo saves automatically).

The teacher's user account is updated immediately: the security group tied to the role is granted, together with everything it implies (e.g. assigning **Department chieff** also grants Tutor and Teacher access).

> The **Tutor**, **Department chieff**, **Seminar leader**, **Head of studies**, **Deputy head of studies**, **Secretary** and **Director** roles cannot be added or removed manually — neither from here, nor from the role's own **Assigned to** list (**Educational Community → Configuration → Teachers/ASP → Roles**), nor through any bulk edit or import. Trying any of these shows a message naming exactly where the change actually has to be made instead. Tutor is managed automatically based on whether the teacher is set as the tutor of a Class Group; the next five are managed automatically from a department's own form; Director is managed automatically from Settings (see below).

---

## Remove a Role

1. Open the teacher's employee record.
2. In the **Roles** field, remove the role.
3. Click **Save**.

The corresponding security group (and anything only that role justified) is revoked from the teacher's user account.

---

## Assigning a Department Chief / Seminar Chief

Unlike the other roles above, **Department chieff** and **Seminar leader** are not set from the teacher's own record — they are set from the department:

1. Navigate to **Employees → Departments** and open the department.
2. Set **Department Chief** (the department's `Manager` field, required) and, optionally, **Seminar Chief**.
3. Click **Save**.

This has an immediate, automatic effect on every teacher in that department:

- Every teacher in the department, **except the Department Chief**, gets their **Manager** set to the **Seminar Chief**.
- The **Seminar Chief**'s own **Manager** is set to the **Department Chief**.
- If no **Seminar Chief** is set, every teacher in the department (except the Department Chief) gets their **Manager** set directly to the **Department Chief** instead — the Seminar Chief level is simply skipped.
- The **Manager** field on a teacher's own record is read-only — it can only be changed by editing the department, never directly on the teacher's record.
- Reassigning either role to a different teacher automatically revokes it from whoever held it before (in that department).

> **Note for existing departments:** a department created before this feature was enabled may have no Department Chief and/or Seminar Chief until an admin opens it and sets them — nothing is filled in automatically. **Department Chief is required** to save the department form going forward.

---

## Customizing a Department's Color

Each department also has its own color, shown as a swatch on the department's list, form and kanban views. To change it:

1. Navigate to **Employees → Departments** and open the department.
2. Click its color swatch — pick any color you like, there is no fixed list to choose from.
3. Click **Save**.

---

## A department with no Chief of its own (Shares Manager with Parent)

Not every department needs its own Department Chief. If a department is small enough to be managed directly by its parent department's own Chief/Area Manager, tick **Shares Manager with Parent** instead of setting a Department Chief:

1. Navigate to **Employees → Departments** and open the department. It must already have a parent department.
2. Tick **Shares Manager with Parent** — this clears the **Manager** field and hides it, since the department no longer has one of its own.
3. Click **Save**.

Every teacher in that department (and, if it itself has sub-departments, their own Department Chief too) gets their **Manager** set to the nearest ancestor department's own Chief/Area Manager — climbing up the hierarchy as many levels as needed until one is found. A department cannot have both its own Manager and this checkbox ticked at the same time.

---

## Assigning an Area Manager (Head of Studies / Deputy / Secretary)

Some departments (currently **VET**, **ESO/BTX** and **ASP**) are **top-level departments** — this changes their form:

1. Navigate to **Employees → Departments** and open the department. The **Top-level Department** checkbox is already ticked for VET, ESO/BTX and ASP.
2. The department can no longer have a parent department, and has no Seminar Chief — instead of "Department Chief", the Manager field is labelled **Area Manager**.
3. Choose the **Area** (required): **Academic** (VET, ESO/BTX) or **ASP**. This determines which **Role** you're allowed to pick next.
4. Set the **Area Manager** (required) and choose their **Role**: **Head of studies** or **Deputy head of studies** for an Academic area, **Secretary** for an ASP area — picking a Role that doesn't match the Area is rejected.
5. Click **Save**.

Which **Area**/**Role** to pick depends on the department: VET and ESO/BTX are Academic areas, so their Area Manager is normally Head of studies or Deputy; **ASP is different** — its Area is ASP, its Area Manager is a teacher coordinating the administrative/secretariat staff, so its Role should be **Secretary** (this grants the separate Secretary permission block, not an academic one — see the note under the permission table above).

This has an effect beyond the department itself:

- Every other department placed *under* a top-level department (e.g. "Computer Science" under VET, or "Secretariat"/"Conciergerie" under ASP) has its own **Department Chief**'s **Manager** automatically set to the top-level department's **Area Manager**. Nothing else about that department changes — its own teachers and Seminar Chief keep working exactly as before, only its own Department Chief's Manager changes.
- Since **Head of studies**, **Deputy head of studies** and **Secretary** can each only be held by one person centre-wide, trying to set the same one on two different departments for two different people is rejected — clear the other assignment first if you need to reassign.

> **Note for existing departments:** VET, ESO/BTX and ASP are already marked as top-level, but with no Area Manager set yet — an admin must open each one and set it manually; nothing is filled in automatically.

---

## Assigning the Director

Unlike every other role above, the **Director** is not set from any teacher's record or any department form — it is configured centre-wide from Settings:

1. Navigate to **Settings → EMS Management → Center Data**.
2. Set the **Director**.
3. Click **Save**.

This has an effect beyond the setting itself:

- The **Manager** of every top-level department's Area Manager (e.g. VET's, ESO/BTX's, ASP's) is automatically set to the **Director** — unless the Director is themselves heading that top-level department, in which case their own Manager is left blank.
- Reassigning the Director to someone else automatically revokes the role from whoever held it before.

> **Note on access:** the Settings screen requires Odoo's Settings access (granted through the "Settings Administrator" group or root/admin) — this is a *different* permission from the one that controls the department forms above. Someone with full academic access is not automatically able to reach Settings.

> **Note for existing installations:** no Director is set by default — an admin must configure one manually; nothing is filled in automatically.
