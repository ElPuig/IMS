# Teacher Working Schedules & Schedule Frameworks

Manage each teacher's weekly timetable from their own employee record, and set up the bell-schedule templates ("schedule frameworks") new teachers start from.

**Required role:** Department Chief or above (Department Chief, Head of Studies, Director, Administrator) can edit schedules and use the import wizard; every other role can only view their own schedule, read-only, but everyone can export a schedule to PDF.

---

## Concepts

- **Schedule framework**: a reusable weekly bell-schedule template (periods, breaks, coordination meetings) for a level of studies — e.g. one framework for ESO, one for BTX, one shared by the vocational-training levels. Frameworks never carry real subject assignments.
- **A teacher's schedule**: their own personal calendar, built from a framework and then filled in with their actual subjects/groups. It is never shared between two teachers.
- **Default schedule framework**: the one framework automatically used to start every new teacher's schedule.
- **Reinforcement group**: a class group that mixes students from different regular groups (and even different studies) for a specific reinforcement class — it has no tutor or delegate, but still appears in a teacher's schedule like any other group. See "Reinforcement Groups" below.

---

## Access

- Schedule frameworks: **Configuration → Teachers → Schedule frameworks**
- Default framework setting: **Settings → Employees → "Default schedule framework"**
- A teacher's own schedule: **Employees → [open the teacher] → Schedule** tab
- Batch import from a file: **Configuration → Teachers → Working schedules** → ⚙️ (cog) menu → **Import: planner data**

---

## Set Up a Schedule Framework

1. Go to **Configuration → Teachers → Schedule frameworks** and create a new one (or open an existing one).
2. Set its **Name** and, if it's specific to one level of studies, its **Level**.
3. Add its weekly periods in the attendance lines below: day, start/end time, and optionally a name. Use exact times — periods don't need to be aligned to the hour (e.g. `10:25–11:25`).
4. For breaks and coordination meetings, use the **non-teaching** field on that line (e.g. `Break`, `Coordination Meeting`) instead of leaving it blank — these are real commitments every teacher following the framework will inherit.

> A framework is a template only: it never has subjects or groups assigned to its own periods.

---

## Co-teaching

If two teachers genuinely teach the same class together (same subject, same group, same room, same hour), EMS treats it as a **single** shared class rather than two independent ones: both teachers are listed as holders of that period, and there is only **one** attendance session for it — either teacher can mark it, and both see the same result.

This is detected automatically, whether the schedule was built by hand or imported:
- **Editing a schedule by hand**: if you assign a teacher to a period that exactly matches (same subject, group, room, day and time) a period already assigned to another teacher, EMS merges them into a shared period instead of raising a room-conflict error. If a teacher is later removed from that period while their co-teacher keeps it, the shared period simply reverts to being that co-teacher's own.
- **Importing schedules**: if a planner file assigns the exact same class to two teachers, importing it produces one shared period, the same as if you'd set it up by hand.

A shared period is otherwise not any different to look at: it just shows up, identically, on each holder's own **Schedule** tab.

---

## Set the Default Schedule Framework

1. Go to **Settings → Employees**.
2. Under **Default schedule framework**, pick the framework every *new* teacher should start from.
3. Save.

This field is required — the module ships with a generic default framework so it is never empty out of the box, but you should point it at the framework that matches your centre's most common level.

---

## Manage Non-teaching Types

The list of non-teaching reasons (Break, Guard, Coordination Meeting...) shown wherever a period isn't a subject is configurable, so you can add a new one yourself if your centre's external planner starts sending a code EMS doesn't recognise yet — no developer needed.

1. Go to **Configuration → Teachers → Non-teaching types**.
2. Click **New**, set a short **Code** (must match exactly what the external planner uses for that activity) and a **Name** (what teachers and reports will show).
3. Optionally mark it **Is a break** (dropped from the weekly hours summary entirely, like the patio break) or **Always a fixed-schedule commitment** (always counted in the "Other fixed-schedule hours" column, like a guard duty).
4. Save. The new type is immediately available in the "non-teaching" dropdown when editing a schedule, and recognised the next time you import a planner file that uses its code.

---

## A New Teacher's Schedule

When you create a new employee of type **Teacher**, EMS automatically:
- creates a personal working calendar for them (never shared with anyone else),
- points it at the centre's default schedule framework.

Nothing needs to be assigned yet — open their **Schedule** tab and use **Edit** to start filling in subjects, following the "Edit a Teacher's Schedule" section below. Renaming the teacher later automatically renames their calendar to match; deleting the teacher automatically deletes their personal calendar.

---

## View a Teacher's Schedule

1. Open the teacher's employee record.
2. Go to the **Schedule** tab.

Each block shows its exact start–end time, the subject/group or the non-teaching reason, and the classroom (taken from the group's own default classroom). Periods that are still unassigned simply show no block — the framework's structure (breaks, meetings) is what tells you a slot is expected there.

Below the grid, a small summary table shows the teacher's total weekly hours in two columns:
- **Weekly teaching hours**: one row per level of studies (e.g. CFGS, CFGM, ESO), one row per reinforcement group taught (these don't belong to a single level), plus any non-teaching activity not listed in the other column.
- **Other fixed-schedule hours**: guard duties (any day) and coordination meetings specifically on Wednesday.

The break is never counted in either column. A period that only partially overlaps an hour still counts as a full hour. Each column shows its own total, followed by the overall total (24 hours for a full-time teacher). This summary always reflects the saved schedule, so it disappears while you're editing and reappears (updated) once you save.

A block for a break the teacher hasn't explicitly set up may still show, filled in automatically from the schedule framework(s) of the level(s) the teacher actually teaches — this is a visual aid only; nothing is actually saved for it until it's added as a real card in Edit mode (see below).

Two blocks sharing the exact same time (see "Mid-Course Subject Handoff" below) show side by side instead of one hiding the other.

---

## Edit a Teacher's Schedule

The weekly grid splits into 5 day columns (Monday–Friday); within each day, independent **cards** — one per real or still-unassigned period — hold everything about that block: an optional date range, its own start/end time, a subject/group or a non-teaching reason, and a classroom.

1. Open the teacher's **Schedule** tab and click **Edit**.
2. Each day's column starts pre-filled with the framework's own periods (including its breaks/meetings) as blank cards — pick a **subject** and a **group** for one, or a **non-teaching** reason, from its own dropdowns.
3. To change a card's time: edit its start or end time field directly (moving the start keeps the card's length).
4. To set a classroom other than the group's own default: pick one from the card's own **Classroom** dropdown — leave it blank to keep using the group's default.
5. To remove a card entirely: use its own trash icon.
6. To add a card the framework didn't have (e.g. a teacher who mixes two levels' bell schedules, or the same weekday/time with two different subjects at different points in the year — see "Mid-Course Subject Handoff" below): click **+ Add** at the bottom of that day's column, set its time, and fill it in.
7. Click **Save** to apply, or **Cancel** to discard everything and leave the schedule untouched.

   ![Two cards on the same weekday, each with its own date range, time, subject, group and classroom](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-edit-cards.png)

Cards within a day are always shown sorted by start time, then end time — two cards at the exact same time sort by their own start date instead.

> Leaving a manually-added card unassigned and saving simply drops it — only real assignments are kept. If you re-open **Edit** later, the framework's own cards reappear as gaps to fill in, but a discarded manual card does not.

There is no drag-and-drop between cards or days — to move a card to a different day, remove it and add a new one there instead.

---

## Mid-Course Subject Handoff

The same weekday/time/room slot can hold two different subjects across the year — e.g. a regular module runs until February, then the end-of-course project takes over the exact same slot for the rest of the year. Set both halves up on the calendar upfront, in September, instead of having to remember to edit the schedule on the actual handoff day.

1. Open the teacher's **Schedule** tab and click **Edit**.
2. Fill in the first card as usual (subject, group, time).
3. Set its two date fields (start, then end) to the first half of the year (e.g. September to February).
4. Click **+ Add** on the same day to add a second card, and give it the exact same start/end time as the first.
5. Fill in the second card with the other subject/group, and set its own two date fields to the rest of the year (e.g. March to July).
6. Click **Save**.

   ![Both subjects showing side by side on Monday's read-only weekly grid](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-midcourse-handoff.png)

Both cards then show up side by side on the read-only weekly grid, instead of one hiding the other. Leaving a card's date fields blank means "valid all course year" — the normal, unchanged default for a card that never needs to hand off to anything else.

---

## Import Working Schedules From a File

If your centre already exports schedules from an external planning tool (XML), use the batch importer instead of building schedules by hand — each file can already describe several teachers at once (matched by e-mail), and you can attach more than one file in the same run. There is no separate per-teacher import any more: a teacher joining mid-year gets their schedule via **New** on their own **Schedule** tab (see "Start a Teacher's Schedule From a Framework or From Another Teacher" below) or by hand, never a single-teacher file upload.

The wizard walks you through several screens, each showing its own short explanation of what it checks and what to do with it — the numbered steps below are a detailed reference, not the only place to find out what's going on.

1. Go to **Configuration → Teachers → Working schedules**.
2. Open the ⚙️ (cog) menu above the list and choose **Import: planner data**.
3. On the **Welcome** screen, attach one or more XML files and choose how this import should treat each teacher's existing schedule:
   - **Combine with each teacher's existing schedule** (the default) — nothing a teacher already has is lost unless these files also describe it. Use this for a teacher shared between departments whose files are imported at different times (e.g. a reinforcement teacher, one file per department).
   - **Replace each teacher's existing schedule entirely** — these files become that teacher's complete schedule; anything they had that isn't in these files is dropped. Use this when a file is meant to be the full, authoritative description of a teacher's week.

   Either way, if these files describe the exact same day and time a teacher already had something else scheduled, the new one always wins. Uploading several files together in the same run (e.g. one per department) always combines them with each other first, regardless of which option you pick — the choice only affects what happens to a teacher's schedule from an **earlier, separate** import.

   Then click **Continue** — nothing is written yet at this point, and nothing about the files' content is checked here either.

   ![The wizard's Welcome screen with a planner file attached](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-01-welcome.png)
4. If the files mention any group name EMS couldn't match automatically, a **Resolve groups** screen lists each one: pick the real group from the dropdown for each row (or create one on the spot, the same way you would from any other group field), then click **Continue**. If every group was recognized automatically, you'll see a confirmation message instead of a list. **Continue** shows grayed out until every row has a group picked.

   ![The Resolve groups screen listing an unresolved group name found in the file](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-02-resolve-groups.png)

   This same screen also checks that every group referenced already has a classroom set — a group whose name resolved just fine but has no room of its own gets its own second list here, right below the first. Pick a classroom for each one and click **Continue**; the classroom you pick is saved on the group itself, not just for this one import, so you'll never be asked again for that group. If nothing is missing, you won't see this second list at all.

   ![The Resolve groups screen listing a group that resolved fine but still has no classroom assigned](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-02b-resolve-groups-classroom.png)
5. If a file names a subject that isn't actually taught in the group's own study (a wrong subject code, or a group assigned to the wrong subject), a **Resolve subjects** screen lists each mismatch, letting you correct **either side** — whichever one was actually the mistake: the **Group(s)** field starts on the file's own group(s) but can be changed (remove the wrong one, add the right one, same as any other group tag field); the **Subject** dropdown starts on the file's own subject and only lets you pick one actually taught in the group's (possibly just-corrected) study. Fixing the group alone is often enough on its own, if the file's subject was right all along. If every subject matched correctly, you'll see a confirmation message instead. **Continue** shows grayed out until every row has a valid combination.

   ![The Resolve subjects screen listing a subject/group mismatch found in the file](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-03-resolve-subjects.png)
6. If the files mention a teacher e-mail or not-yet-hired post code (`X1`, `X2`...) EMS couldn't match to an existing teacher, a **Resolve teachers** screen lists each one, with **New** ticked by default (assuming a genuinely never-hired teacher) — leave it ticked to create a brand-new pending-identification teacher for it at the final Import step (see "Teachers Not Yet Hired" below); for an e-mail-shaped row, the file's own e-mail is additionally kept and pre-filled as their **Work email**, editable by hand (**Assign corporate email manually** ticked) rather than auto-generated, since it hasn't been confirmed yet. If it's actually a typo/mismatch of an already-existing teacher — or a code/e-mail you recognize as the SAME real person already listed under a different row on this same screen — untick **New** and pick the real teacher from the dropdown instead (unticking is what unlocks it); picking the same teacher for two different rows resolves both to that one person, no duplicate created. If every e-mail/code was recognized, you'll see a confirmation message instead. **Continue** shows grayed out here too until every row has either a teacher picked or **New** ticked.

   ![The Resolve teachers screen with the New checkbox before the Teacher dropdown](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-04-resolve-teachers.png)
7. If two different teachers in the same batch end up scheduled in the same classroom at the same time — or the same real teacher (e.g. two identifiers you resolved to the same person on the previous screen) ends up double-booked at the same time in two different rooms — a **File conflicts** screen lists every colliding pair, grouped into a card per conflict type ("Co-teaching", "Split session", "Room conflict", "Same teacher, different room"), and within each card, one block per teacher+subject combination (ignoring which specific group/day/time each individual pair happens to fall on) holding every pair that shares it. Each block has its own dropdown at the top ("— apply to all —") — pick a resolution there and it's applied to every row underneath at once (you can still change any individual row by hand afterward). Each row spells out both colliding entries in full, joined by **"vs."** — reading left to right is what "Left"/"Right" mean in the resolution options below. The resolution options themselves: **"Confirm"** if they're genuinely sharing that class (only offered for "Co-teaching" rows); **"Reassign rooms"** for a real room clash — pick the actual room for each side, since both start pre-filled with the same colliding one; or **"Left prevails"/"Right prevails"** to simply keep one side (the one before/after "vs." on that row) and drop the other. A "Same teacher, different room" row only ever offers "Left prevails"/"Right prevails" — reassigning a room fixes nothing when the real problem is one teacher needed in two places at once. If there's nothing to resolve, you'll see a confirmation message instead. **Continue** shows grayed out until every row has an actual resolution (for "Reassign rooms", that means the two rooms must actually differ).

   ![The File conflicts screen grouped into a card, with a bulk resolution dropdown above each colliding pair](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-05-file-conflicts.png)
8. If any entry from the file collides with a classroom+time already actively used by someone else's existing schedule, an **Existing schedule conflicts** screen lists each one the same grouped-cards way — here each row explicitly prefixes its two sides **"File: ..."** (the new entry) and **"Database: ..."** (the already-existing session), instead of "vs." — "Left prevails" always means the **File** side wins, "Right prevails" always means the **Database** side wins, matching that same order. With the same resolution options as "File conflicts" above: choosing **"Left prevails"** archives the existing session (freeing the slot for the new one); choosing **"Right prevails"** drops the new entry instead, keeping the existing session untouched. If there's nothing to resolve, you'll see a confirmation message instead.

   ![The Existing schedule conflicts screen, showing a File entry colliding with a Database session](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-06-existing-schedule-conflicts.png)
9. An **Overall summary** screen recaps the whole run before you commit to it: a count of every unresolved group name, teacher e-mail/code, pending teacher, and conflict resolved along the way, plus a list of every teacher this import already matched to a real, existing employee (whether recognized automatically or corrected on the "Resolve teachers" screen) — a heads-up that this import is about to update (override) their schedule/subject assignments. If none of the file's teachers already exist, you'll see a confirmation message instead of that list. Since none of the earlier steps let you go back, this is your last chance to check everything looks right before clicking Import.

   ![The Overall summary screen recapping every resolution made during the import](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-07-overall-summary.png)

   As soon as this screen appears, a CSV file with that same summary — one row per resolution made — downloads to your computer automatically, ready to keep as your own record of the run. Scroll to the bottom of the screen to see the download link if you want to grab it again.

   ![The download link for the summary CSV at the bottom of the Overall summary screen](../../assets/admin/working-schedules-import-07b-overall-summary-download.png)
10. Click **Import**. This is the point where everything is actually written.

> Run this during next-course preparation, once the previous course's schedules have already been archived by the "Setting Up the Next Course" wizard — running it against a course already in progress can create conflicts that then need manual resolution.

If any of the teachers found across the files already has a schedule, it's updated once you click **Import** according to whichever option you picked on the Welcome screen (combine or replace) — existing subject assignments and attendance templates stay in sync with the result either way.

---

## Teachers Not Yet Hired (Pending Identification)

New timetables sometimes arrive before every post is staffed — your planner tool names those rows with a placeholder code (`X1`, `X2`...) instead of a real teacher's e-mail. Importing such a file no longer fails on those rows:

> The same pending-identification mechanism also covers a genuine e-mail that doesn't match any existing teacher — tick **New** for that row on the **Resolve teachers** screen instead of picking one (see step 5 of "Import Working Schedules From a File" above). The only difference from a placeholder code is that the file's e-mail is kept, pre-filled as an editable **Work email** (**Assign corporate email manually** ticked), rather than left for a later "Generate Google account" to assign automatically.

1. Attach the file and click through the wizard as usual (see "Import Working Schedules From a File" above) — a placeholder code isn't treated as a problem at any step.
2. Click **Import** on the final step. A new employee record is created for each not-yet-identified code, already named e.g. "Pending teacher (X1)", with **their schedule, subjects and attendance lists already set up** exactly as if they were a known teacher.
3. These records show a **"Pending identification"** badge in the Teachers list/kanban and a ribbon on their own form, so they're easy to find (use the **Pending identification** filter/group-by in the Teachers list) and easy to tell apart from a real, already-identified teacher.

When the post is filled:

1. Open the pending teacher's employee record.
2. Replace the placeholder **Name** with the real teacher's name, and fill in their **Personal email**.
3. Click **Generate Google account**, exactly as you would for any new teacher.

That single click both creates the teacher's Google Workspace account/EMS login **and** confirms their identity — the "Pending identification" badge disappears, and nothing about their already-imported schedule, subjects or attendance lists needs to be redone.

If this pending teacher will never get a Google Workspace/EMS account created from this record (e.g. they already have an account under a different, unmerged record, or the post turns out not to need one), open their record and click **Mark as identified** in the header instead. After confirming, it clears the "Pending identification" badge on its own, without creating any account — use it only as a manual override for cases **Generate Google account** doesn't cover.

Re-importing an updated file for a post that's still unstaffed (same placeholder code) updates that same pending teacher's schedule in place, the same way re-importing an already-identified teacher's file does — it never creates a second, duplicate record for the same code.

---

## Start a Teacher's Schedule From a Framework or From Another Teacher

Use this to reset a teacher onto a different framework (e.g. they now teach a different level), or to set up a **substitute** with the same schedule as the teacher they're covering for:

1. Open the teacher's **Schedule** tab and click **New**.
2. Choose either a **schedule framework** (starts blank, following that framework's periods) or **another teacher** (copies their real subjects/groups — ideal for substitutions).
3. Click **Load** — you'll see the loaded schedule in edit mode.
4. Adjust anything needed, then click **Save** to apply, or **Cancel** to discard and keep the teacher's previous schedule untouched.

> **New** replaces the whole schedule — nothing from before is kept unless it also appears in what you just loaded. Cancelling before Save leaves everything exactly as it was.

---

## Reinforcement Groups

A reinforcement group is a class **group** (the same "Groups" record a regular class group is) used for a support/reinforcement class that mixes students from different regular groups, and even different studies — e.g. a small maths reinforcement group with students pulled from three different first-year groups.

1. Go to **Configuration → Students → Groups** and create a new one.
2. Set its **Group type** to **Reinforcement**. This hides the Level/Study/Course/Acronym/Tutor/Delegate fields (a reinforcement group has none of these) and lets you type the group's **Name** directly — set it to exactly match whatever your external planner exports for this group, since the schedule importer matches by exact name.
3. Set its **Classroom**, same as any other group — it's still required for the schedule to import correctly.
4. On the **Students** tab, add the students who attend this reinforcement class, regardless of which regular group or study they belong to. This does **not** change each student's own main group.
5. Save.

Once created, a reinforcement group is used in a teacher's schedule exactly like any other group — assign it manually in the Schedule tab, or let the file importer resolve it by name.

---

## Export a Teacher's Schedule to PDF

1. Open the teacher's **Schedule** tab and click **PDF**.
2. A printable weekly timetable is generated and downloaded — one row per period, one column per weekday, each cell showing the subject/group or non-teaching reason and the classroom.

The document opens with the teacher's name and the current course, followed by their department (if assigned) and their role(s) — a tutor's line also shows which group they tutor, and a department head's line shows which department.

This is also available from the employee form's own **Print** menu, in case you need to export several teachers' schedules from a list view.
