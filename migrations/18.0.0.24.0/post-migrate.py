    '_relocate_via_calendar_blocks'/'_archive_via_calendar_blocks' docstrings and
    docs/en/developers/attendance/attendance_template.md's "Bottom-up sync redesign" section):
    the design invariant those two shared methods (and 'ems.group._resolve_or_flag_pending_block')
    now rely on is that every active 'ems.attendance_schedule' line always has at least one real
    'resource.calendar.attendance' row pointing at it via 'attendance_schedule_id' - the calendar is
    always the entry point, never the other way round.

    That FK is only ever set by 'ems.attendance_template._link_calendar_attendance', called at the
    end of 'sync_from_schedule_batch' - a calendar block created or resynced before this FK column
    existed (added 2026-08-11) or before the automatic create/write/unlink hook existed (added the
    same day as this migration, see the bottom-up sync redesign's Phase 4) never went through that
    step, so it can be missing the link even though a matching schedule line genuinely exists.

    Rather than writing a bespoke matching query here, this reuses the exact same full
    archive-and-rebuild-from-calendar tool already used by 'migrations/18.0.0.22.0' and
    'migrations/18.0.0.23.1'/'18.0.0.23.5' for the original calendar-driven-templates rollout -
    'regenerate_all_from_calendars()' rebuilds every active template/line straight from each
    teacher's current calendar and links every calendar row it touches by construction, so running
    it once more here closes this exact gap without inventing new logic. Confirmed via a dry run
    against this project's own dev database (2026-09-08, rolled back, never committed): 11
