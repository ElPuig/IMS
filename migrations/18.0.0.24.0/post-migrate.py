    implication, 'group_hr_holidays_user' and 'hr.group_hr_user' - so every teacher could read
    every colleague's absence reason and supporting document, and every employee record besides.

    This is also what grants the approver group to whoever is actually named as an employee's
    'leave_manager_id', which no group chain can express, and what removes it from the members of
    the secretariat, who used to inherit it from 'ems.group_secretary' (that implication is
    dropped declaratively in security/groups.xml, but Odoo's implied-group writes are additive
    and never revoke what a user already materialised).
