def _regenerate_attendance_templates_from_calendars(env):
    """Fixes production data left behind by the bug fixed in this same version
    (`ems.attendance_template._plan_schedule_sync`, see models/attendance/attendance_template.py):
    a solo teacher who taught one subject to two or more different groups (no co-teaching) could
    have every one of their templates for that subject silently archived, with nothing recreated
    in their place, the next time their schedule was resynced (a working-schedules re-import, or a
    live edit on their own Schedule tab) - even though their calendar stayed completely correct.

    Rather than trying to detect which teachers were actually hit (a targeted detection would risk
    fragmenting a co-taught template if it missed one side of it - a real teacher who splits a
    reconstructed group differently from before), this reuses the exact same
    `regenerate_all_from_calendars()` full rebuild already used by `migrations/18.0.0.22.0` for the
    original calendar-driven-templates rollout: archive every active template, rebuild an
    equivalent set from each teacher's CURRENT (correct) calendar. Safe to run again - archiving
    never touches real attendance-session history (see that method's own docstring) - at the cost
    of every already-correct template also getting a new id/color even though nothing about it
    actually changes."""

    this same version, see models/attendance/attendance_template.py): from now on, a superseded
    template with no real attendance history gets deleted outright instead of archived forever -
    but that only affects templates archived FROM THIS POINT ON. Every template ALREADY sitting
    archived from before this fix (found from a real complaint: repeatedly re-importing working
    schedules to fix small details, several times in one day, leaves hundreds of never-used
    archived templates behind) needs this separate one-time sweep, since it was never touched by
    the sync pipeline's own archive-or-delete decision at the time it was archived.

    Reuses `_has_real_sessions()` (checks every schedule line, active or archived, for a real
    `attendance_session_ids` entry) as the exact same safety predicate `unlink()` itself enforces -
    this can never delete a template with real history, and the DB-level `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on
    `ems_attendance_session_header.attendance_schedule_id` would refuse the delete outright even if
