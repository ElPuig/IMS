# EMS — Educational Management System

An open-source Odoo v18 module for managing an educational centre. Developed by teachers at Institut Puig Castellar (Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Barcelona) as part of the Quality and Continuous Improvement Project (Q&CIP).

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Odoo v18, Python 3
- **Frontend:** OWL (Odoo Web Library), XML views, JavaScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL — database name is `ems`
- **Official reference:** https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/ (always consult before making technical decisions)

## This environment is development, not production

The `ems` PostgreSQL database on this box — the one `psql -d ems`, `./upgrade.sh` and
`./test.sh` all operate on — is a **development/sandbox database. It is not production**,
regardless of how plausible its data looks (real-looking student names, hundreds of rows,
counts that seem too specific to be fake). There is no direct access to the real production
database from this environment.

**How to apply:** never phrase a finding from a local `psql -d ems` query as a fact about
"production" — phrase it as a fact about this dev database (e.g. "0 rows in this dev DB",
not "0 rows in production"). If a finding needs confirming against real production data
before it can inform a decision (an incident report, a data-quality question, an urgency
call), **ask the developer** — either for the specific query results run directly against
prod, or for an unimported backup dump left somewhere readable, which can be restored into a
**new, separate** database (the `odoo` OS/Postgres role has `CREATEDB`; use
`sudo -u odoo createdb <name>` + `pg_restore`/`psql -d <name>`, mirroring the
`sudo -u odoo psql ...` pattern `upgrade.sh` already uses for privileged writes) — never
restore over the existing `ems` dev database, which the running Odoo instance and the test
suite both depend on staying intact. See `feedback_dont_conflate_sandbox_with_prod` in
memory for the incident this rule comes from, and a second, broader one from 2026-07-30
where dev-DB findings were repeatedly mislabeled "production" across an entire session
before being caught.

## Development vs. production environment declaration (2026-08-10)

Any EMS installation — this box included — declares whether it's a development/testing
environment or a real production one via a single `ir.config_parameter`:
**`ems.environment_type`**, value `'dev'` or `'production'`. Three scripts set it, so every
install ends up with it declared regardless of which path it took:

- **`install.sh`** (the one step every installation goes through, with no alternative) asks
  interactively — or accepts it as a first CLI argument (`prod`/`dev`) for non-interactive
  runs — right after the initial `-i ems` install succeeds.
- **`devel.sh`** always forces it to `'dev'` as its last step (in case `install.sh`'s original
  answer was wrong, or a box's role changed).
- **`deploy.sh`** (this repo's own production deploy pipeline, run by the self-hosted GitHub
  Actions runner) always forces it to `'production'` on every deploy, for the same reason.

`res.company._register_hook()` (`models/settings/company.py`) logs a `WARNING` once per server
start if the parameter is missing entirely — skipped automatically during any automated test run
(`config['test_enable']`), so a throwaway CI/`test.sh` database never triggers it; this can never
fire in this repo's own production either, since `deploy.sh` always sets it. The only way to see
it is a database that genuinely never went through any of the three scripts above (e.g. an
existing installation that predates this mechanism, or a hand-rolled restore that skipped
`install.sh` entirely).

**Why this exists, and how to apply it (the incident this is a direct response to):** a
colleague (Juan) asked a different Claude session to prepare a real production backup for
restoring on his own dev box. That session had no way to know `devel.sh` (below) already
neutralizes the real-recipient email risk, so — lacking that context — it recommended disabling
the configured outgoing mail servers (`ir.mail_server`) as a safety measure instead. That's
unnecessary once `devel.sh` has actually run (see below), and actively counter-productive: it
removes the ability to verify a real email delivery reaches the developer's own inbox during
interactive testing, without adding any protection `devel.sh`'s own address-rewriting doesn't
already provide.

**How a future Claude session (yours, or a colleague's) should actually apply this — don't rely
on spotting the log warning:** a log line only helps whoever is watching that specific log at
that specific moment; if a colleague restores a database in their own session, you have no
visibility into their terminal or their Odoo log. This is a **one-off check, not a standing
habit** — there is no need to re-check on every message or every tool call within the same
session once it's been done. The whole point of this entire mechanism is to stop a real email
ever reaching a real production address, so the actual trigger to check is narrower and more
concrete than "any real data": **does whatever is about to be tested or touched have anything to
do with outgoing email** — sending a notification, a reminder, a Google account credential email,
a schedule-import confirmation, anything that could plausibly call `mail.mail.send()`/
`message_post()`/similar. If it doesn't touch outgoing email at all, this never needs checking,
regardless of how real or sensitive the underlying data otherwise looks. It's also worth checking
before considering a mail-server-disabling "safety" step for the same reason. Outside those
moments, most work on this repo (writing/reviewing code, running the automated test suite) never
needs this check at all. When one of those moments comes up, check directly instead of guessing
or relying on having seen a warning:
```
sudo -u odoo psql -d ems -c "SELECT value FROM ir_config_parameter WHERE key='ems.environment_type';"
```
If it's `'dev'`, `devel.sh` has already run and neutralized the real-email risk (see below) — no
further action needed, and disabling mail servers would only get in the way. If it's empty on a
database that clearly has real-looking data (the same smell described in the section above), stop
and ask the developer whether `devel.sh` needs to run before continuing.

### `devel.sh`: what it actually does, and why disabling mail servers on top is unnecessary

`devel.sh` (interactive, or non-interactive via `./devel.sh <google_account> [domain]`) is the
script that turns a freshly-restored real backup into a safe local dev environment: among other
things (enabling the debugger, cancelling stuck queue jobs), it rewrites **every** stored email
address (`res_partner.email`/`email_normalized`/`student_email`, plus the dependent
`hr_employee.work_email`) to `<google_account>+<original_email, '@' encoded as '_at_'>@<domain>`
— e.g. `kandilhamza@gmail.com` becomes `porrino.fernando+kandilhamza_at_gmail.com@elpuig.xeill.net`.
`<domain>` always gets overwritten (never kept from the original address, regardless of what it
was) — defaults to `res.company.google_ws_domain` (the same setting the Google Workspace
integration itself uses), offered as the default for the interactive prompt and also acceptable
as a second CLI argument. Overwriting the domain, rather than keeping the original one, is what
actually guarantees delivery to a domain the developer provably controls — keeping a family's
own `gmail.com`/`hotmail.com`/etc. domain would only "accidentally" reach the developer if their
own account happens to exist on that exact same external domain too, which isn't something to
rely on.

Given this, once `devel.sh` has run (check the `ems.environment_type` parameter above, don't
guess), **no real person can ever receive an email from this environment** — every stored address
already points at the developer's own inbox. Disabling `ir.mail_server` on top would not close
any remaining gap; it would only prevent verifying that a real email genuinely gets delivered and
correctly formatted during manual/interactive testing, which is precisely the scenario `devel.sh`
is designed to make safe to do. The **only** place a mail-server-level (transport) safety net is
actually needed is **automated tests**, a different mechanism for a different scenario — see
"Email safety in tests" below, which mocks `IrMailServer.send_email` directly, since a test run
never goes through `devel.sh`'s database rewrite at all.

```

**`views/`'s top-level folders mirror the app's own menu structure, not `models/`'s domain
folders — the two use genuinely different organizing principles, and a model's own `models/`
folder name is not a reliable guide to where its views belong.** Each top-level `views/` folder
corresponds to one root app menu as it actually appears in the running backend: `community/` ↔
"Educational Community" (`menu_community`), `academic_management/` ↔ "Academic management"
(`menu_ems_academic_management`), `planning_grading/` ↔ "Planning and Grading" (`menu_planning`),
`attendance/` ↔ "Student's Attendances" (`menu_attendance`), `communications/` ↔ "Communications"
(`menu_communications`), `coexistence/` ↔ "Coexistence" (`menu_coexistence`). A handful of
folders don't map to one of EMS's own root app menus, for a different, legitimate reason each:
`settings/` (inherits of the native Settings screens — `res.config.settings`, `base.view_users_form`
— reached from Odoo's own Settings app, not any EMS menu), `portal/` (QWeb website/portal
templates, no backend menu at all), `sales/`, `accounting/` (inherits of native Odoo app screens —
Sales' product form, Accounting's `account.menu_finance` — for the same reason as `settings/`),
`shared/` (cross-model widgets with no menu of their own).

**Before creating or moving a view file, trace its `<menuitem>`'s `parent=` chain up to its root**
(or, for a file with no menuitem of its own — e.g. an inherited form reached only via another
action, like "My Profile" — find which existing view for the same target model *does* define the
menu, and follow that one's chain instead) rather than assuming the matching `models/<area>/`
folder name is also the right `views/` folder. This is exactly how `views/employees/` (a folder
that existed only because `models/employees/` does — no root app menu named "Employees" exists at
all) was found and fixed 2026-09-01: every menu item defined inside it actually resolved up to
`menu_community`, so both its contents (`non_teaching_type/`, `user_profile_form.xml`) moved to
`views/community/`, and the folder was deleted.

## Development scripts

Both scripts must be run from the project root (`/root/myModules/ems/`).

```bash
./upgrade.sh              # Apply module changes to the running instance
./test.sh                 # Run all EMS tests
./test.sh TestClassName   # Run a specific test class
```

`upgrade.sh` and `test.sh` both stop the Odoo service, run their operation as the `odoo` system user, and restart the service. Output is filtered to show only relevant lines (errors, warnings, test results).

After any change, run `upgrade.sh` and check for WARNING / ERROR / CRITICAL output.

**The full test suite is slow — don't run it more than necessary.** `./test.sh` (no argument) runs every test class and takes several minutes; running it after every small change wastes time without adding useful signal. Prefer `./test.sh TestClassName`, scoped to whatever model(s) you're actually touching, as the normal gate during iterative work (Red/Green/Refactor cycles, DTON phases, bug fixes). Run the full, unscoped `./test.sh` only once — as the final check before considering a piece of work done — not after every intermediate step. If a change plausibly affects other models (e.g. a shared mixin, a migration, a widget used in several views), scope down to the smallest set of `TestClassName` runs that actually covers the blast radius instead of reaching for the full suite by default.

**Optimize for quota, not just wall-clock time (2026-08-06) — the project is only getting bigger, so this compounds.** Before running anything (an upgrade, a test, a screenshot-capture loop), think about whether batching verification to the end of a chunk of work costs less than verifying after every small step, or the other way around — it genuinely depends on the situation (e.g. a single risky change with an uncertain outcome is worth checking immediately, so a mistake doesn't get compounded by several more edits on top of it; several small, independent, low-risk edits are usually cheaper to verify once at the end). Don't default to "run the gate after every edit" out of habit — decide deliberately per task. This is a general planning habit across every kind of tool use (edits, greps, screenshots, test runs), not just about `./test.sh`.

**Ask before launching the full, unscoped `./test.sh` at all — even for that single final-gate run.** There is no downside to asking first: CI already runs the full suite unconditionally before anything merges, so a local full run is pure convenience/early-signal, never the actual safety net. Push it as late as possible and check with whoever's driving (the developer, or an AI agent's user) instead of launching it unprompted once work seems done.

**If a test run seems to hang with no output, refresh any browser tab you have open on the Odoo backend.** `--test-enable` spins up a real HTTP server for the duration of any `HttpCase`/tour test (e.g. `test_grade_session_tour`, `test_level_tour`, `test_strike_tour` — pulled in by the full, unscoped `./test.sh`, or by name if you target one directly). Odoo's teardown (`_wait_remaining_requests` in `odoo/tests/common.py`) waits for every open HTTP request against that server to finish before the process can exit — including a stray long-polling (bus) connection from an already-open browser tab pointed at the same host/port, which is designed to never close on its own. Refreshing (no need to close) that tab severs the stale connection and lets the run finish. Scoped runs of test classes with no tour/`HttpCase` tests don't hit this specific hang, but closing/refreshing before *any* `./test.sh` run is the standing habit regardless (see the notification trigger below, which fires for every run, not just tour ones).

**Notification channel policy, updated 2026-09-06 — the older "never call PushNotification, that's settled" ban below is superseded, not deleted, so the history stays legible.** The developer has since installed and configured Remote Control, and set the actual decision rule directly: *"si remote control está operativo, usalo. De lo contrario, usamos las notificaciones. Y si no puedes saber si está activo o no, pues que te diga el usuario como lo quiere hacer (y lo recuerdas para que no te lo tenga que estar recordando)."* Concretely:
- **Known active → use it.** Call `PushNotification` (status `"proactive"`) instead of writing to the file-drop bridge. "Known active" means either a memory record confirming a prior successful delivery this developer has verified, or this same session having already seen one succeed.
- **Known inactive → use the file-drop bridge** (the mechanism described just below), the same way this project always has.
- **Genuinely unknown (no memory record, nothing confirmed yet this session, or a call's outcome is ambiguous) → ask the developer directly which channel to use**, rather than guessing or silently defaulting to one. Once they answer, record it in memory (see `project_remote_control_notification_retest`) so a future session doesn't have to ask again.
- **A confirmed-working channel that then visibly fails** (a `PushNotification` call returning the old "silently self-suppressed" symptom, or the developer saying a notification didn't arrive) is a state change, not noise — fall back to the other channel for that occurrence, update the memory record, and don't keep assuming the old status quietly.

Confirmed 2026-09-06: a live `PushNotification` call for a completed task reached the developer's phone, confirmed by them directly ("me ha llegado la notificación") — Remote Control is the current known-active channel per the rule above. The file-drop bridge is **not being removed** either way — it stays available permanently as the fallback (Remote Control becoming unavailable again, or a colleague who prefers the desktop bridge instead).

**Trigger 1 and the policy above, resolved 2026-09-06:** the developer asked for trigger 1 (test-hang) to follow the exact same active/inactive/unknown rule as 2 and 3 — *"usa RemoteControl también si parece que se ha quedado colgado un test. Es lo mismo que los otros."* The automated hook (`/root/.claude/hooks/ems-test-notify.sh`) itself can't be the thing that changes: it's a plain `PreToolUse` shell script running outside the agent's own turn, with no access to the `PushNotification` tool (that's only callable from the agent's own tool-calling interface) — there's no known shell-level equivalent to shell out to. Rather than touch the hook, the **agent supplements it**: right before running a command trigger 1's own classification would flag as needing the browser-tab warning (see trigger 1's own description below — the same full-suite/`*Tour`/`HttpCase`/unclassifiable-`--test-tags` cases), the agent itself also calls `PushNotification` **when Remote Control is known active** (same definition as above), in addition to the hook's own unconditional file-drop write (which keeps firing exactly as before, debounce included - it costs nothing to leave running, and is exactly the fallback for when Remote Control isn't active or the state is unknown for this session). Do not attempt to modify the hook script itself for this — it has no path to the phone-push mechanism.

**Original 2026-08 finding, kept for context (no longer the operative instruction above):** *"Notifications for this developer are handled entirely by an already-built host-side file-drop bridge — never call the `PushNotification` tool on this project. It proved unreliable in this container/VSCode-extension setup (silently self-suppresses as 'terminal active,' no mobile push available here) and only adds noise; do not use it for test or completion notifications here, and do not re-attempt Remote Control/DBus approaches — they don't work in this setup and that's settled."* The working bridge (`~/claude-notify` on the host ↔ `/mnt/claude-notify` in the container, watched by a `systemd --user` service running `notify-send`) is still fully built and verified; full rebuild/troubleshooting steps live in `docs/en/developers/tooling/ai_agent_test_notifications.md` — only needed if the bridge itself ever breaks.

Exactly three triggers should ever produce a notification for this developer:
1. **Launching a test run that actually needs the browser-tab close/refresh** — i.e. one that will exercise a tour/`HttpCase` test (see "If a test run seems to hang" above): the full, unscoped `./test.sh`, a scoped run of a `*Tour`/`HttpCase` class, or a `--test-tags` expression the hook can't cheaply classify (treated as "yes, notify" to stay safe). A scoped run of a plain `TransactionCase`-only class never hits that hang, so it deliberately stays silent — notifying for those too would just be noise (changed 2026-08-01, after being unconditional for a while). This is fully automatic via a `PreToolUse`/`Bash` hook already in the developer's user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`, which pipes the command through `/root/.claude/hooks/ems-test-notify.sh` (checks the class name against `tests/*_tour.py` before deciding) and writes a trigger file to `/mnt/claude-notify/` only when it decides to. This specific trigger is also debounced (added 2026-08-05): several qualifying test launches within 60s of each other only notify once, since iterating on a failing tour otherwise fired one notification per attempt — triggers 2/3 below are deliberately NOT debounced. The hook's own file-drop write needs no agent action and always fires unconditionally — but per the notification channel policy above (2026-09-06), the agent additionally calls `PushNotification` itself for this same trigger whenever Remote Control is known active, since the hook has no way to do that on its own.
2. **Finishing all requested work in a task**, so the developer knows to come back and review. There is no Bash command to hook this on ("all done" isn't a tool call), so the agent must write the trigger file itself, right after concluding a task — code changed, tests run, docs/i18n updated, whatever the task actually required.
3. **Blocking on the developer's input before the agent can continue** — an `AskUserQuestion` call, or any chat message that explicitly asks something and then has nothing left to do but wait for the reply. Without a notification here the developer has no way to know the agent stopped *waiting for them* specifically, as opposed to still working — confirmed in practice (2026-07-24): the agent sat idle mid-task waiting on an answer with no notification, and the developer had no way to know that's what was happening. Fire this right when the question is asked (or immediately after, if the question tool itself doesn't allow a preceding action), every time, not just for big/blocking decisions.

For triggers 2 and 3 (no hook can see either coming — "all done" and "asking a question" aren't Bash commands), the agent fires the notification itself, through whichever channel the policy above resolves to for this developer right now:
- **Remote Control known active:** call `PushNotification` (status `"proactive"`, a short one-line message under 200 characters).
- **Remote Control known inactive:** write the file-drop trigger file:
```bash
echo "$(date +%H:%M:%S) EMS: task done — <short summary>" > /mnt/claude-notify/done-$(date +%s%N).txt
echo "$(date +%H:%M:%S) EMS: waiting on you — <short summary of what's being asked>" > /mnt/claude-notify/waiting-$(date +%s%N).txt
```
- **Genuinely unknown:** ask the developer which one to use (see policy above) before firing anything, then persist their answer.

**Redirect `./test.sh`/`./upgrade.sh` output to a file before inspecting it — never pipe a live run straight into `tail`/`grep` as the only way you look at it.** E.g. `./test.sh TestClassName 2>&1 | tee /path/to/scratchpad/test_output.log`, then `tail`/`grep` against that file for an efficient first pass. Piping directly into `tail`/`grep` on the live command risks silently missing something further up the output, and if that happens the only way to look again is re-running the (slow) run — exactly the redundant-run problem the "don't run the full suite more than necessary" rule above is trying to avoid. With the output already saved to a file, re-reading it (in full, or with a different `tail`/`grep`) costs nothing — only re-run the actual command if the file genuinely doesn't have what's needed (aborted run, or a subsequent code change invalidates it).

## Testing conventions

**Backend tests** — `tests/test_<model>.py`, using `odoo.tests.common.TransactionCase`:
- Cover: valid create, required fields, display_name, admin CRUD, role access restrictions, relation integrity.
- Use `assertRaises(Exception)` for DB-level violations (Odoo's `assertRaises` does not accept exception tuples).
- Use unique codes/acronyms in test data that do not conflict with production data (ESO, BTX, CFGM, CFGS, EFPS, CFGB, PFI already exist).

**Email safety in tests:** this environment's `ir.mail_server` table can point to real, credentialed outgoing servers (e.g. AWS SES, Gmail). Odoo's test runner does **not** suppress real SMTP delivery on its own — `mail.mail.send()` attempts a genuine connection/send even during `TransactionCase`/`HttpCase` tests, regardless of `--test-enable`. Any test whose code path can trigger an email (`send_mail(..., force_send=True)`, `message_post()` with followers, a cron/queue_job send invoked synchronously, etc.) must neutralize real delivery — never let a test send to an address read from seed/production data, since it could be a real person's mailbox. Two options, in order of preference:
- **Default — mock the transport:** patch `odoo.addons.base.models.ir_mail_server.IrMailServer.send_email` (e.g. `unittest.mock.patch(...).start()` + `cls.addClassCleanup(...)` in `setUpClass`) so the full recipient-resolution/template logic still runs and stays assertable, but no network call happens. See `tests/test_strike.py`/`tests/test_strike_tour.py` for the pattern. Use only fictitious addresses (`@example.com` or similar) in test fixtures.
- **Only if explicitly requested by the developer:** if a real send is genuinely needed (e.g. to visually verify formatting), do not use an address read from the database — require an explicit, authorized address from the developer (their own inbox, a designated test mailbox) passed in for that run, and confirm with them before sending.

**Browser (tour) tests** — `static/tests/tours/<model>_tour.js` + `tests/test_<model>_tour.py`:
- Tours use `registry.category("web_tour.tours").add(...)`.
- Navigate to the target via `url: "/odoo/action-ems.<action_id>"` — do not chain menu-click steps.
- Verify data in the list view after save, not via `input[value=...]` (OWL does not sync the HTML attribute).
- Register in `__manifest__.py` under `web.assets_tests`.
- Python side: `@tagged('post_install', '-at_install')`, `self.start_tour("/odoo", "tour_name", login="admin")`.
- To watch a tour run in a real browser during development: add `watch=True` to `start_tour`.

**Tour tests and language:** a tour that asserts on literal English text (a `:contains('Send
now')`-style trigger, an `[title='...']` selector matching a translatable label, a status/
selection name typed nowhere by the tour itself) only works if the account driving it actually
renders in English — never assume that's true. `login="admin"` logs in as this box's real,
pre-existing `admin` account, whose language is whatever this dev box happens to have (this
box's is `es_ES`) — **not** guaranteed `en_US`, regardless of environment. A freshly created
`res.users` record is not automatically safe either: without an explicit `'lang'` key, it does
not reliably default to `en_US` on every box (confirmed on this one: it defaults to `ca_ES`).
Found twice already from the exact same root cause (`TestAttendanceStatusTour`,
`TestNoticeTour`) — a tour step timing out after 10s with **no** console error and **no**
Python traceback initially looked like a hang/race condition, but was actually a translated
label silently never matching a hardcoded English selector; the tour's own auto-saved failure
screenshot (`/tmp/odoo_tests/ems/screenshots/`) is what actually revealed it, not the logs.
**How to apply:**
- Logging in as a real pre-existing account (`login="admin"` or similar) and asserting on
  translatable text: call `force_user_language_to_english(self, self.env.ref('base.user_admin'))`
  (`tests/common.py`) at the start of the test method, before `start_tour(...)` — sets the
  account's language to `en_US` for that test only, restored via `addCleanup`.
- Creating a fresh `res.users` fixture for the tour to log in as: just pass `'lang': 'en_US'`
  explicitly in its `create()` vals — no restore needed, the record itself is test-scoped.
- Prefer structural/position-based selectors (CSS classes, `nth-child`, data attributes) over
  text content wherever the tour doesn't specifically need to assert on a label's value — sidesteps
  the whole class of risk, same fix already applied to `attendance_session_tour.js`'s status
  selectors.
- A tour that only asserts on strings the tour itself typed in (a fixture subject, a computed
  code) is unaffected — the risk is specifically standard Odoo or EMS-module vocabulary
  (button labels, status/selection names) that gets translated out from under a hardcoded
  English selector.

## Coding standards

Follow the official Odoo v18 coding guidelines:
https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/contributing/development/coding_guidelines.html

Key rules applied in this project:
- Class names: PascalCase derived from `_name` (`ems.level` → `EmsLevel`).
- `from odoo import api, fields, models` — alphabetical order.
- Model attribute order: private attrs (`_name`, `_description`, `_order`, `_sql_constraints`) → fields → compute/inverse/search methods → constraints/onchange → CRUD overrides → action methods → business methods.
- Loop variable named after the model, not `rec` (`for level in self:`).
- **No shadowed builtins** (`list`, `type`, `hash`, `bytes`, `id`, `date`, ...) as local variable or parameter names — this bug class was found by hand several times during the DTON rollout (`LimesurveyApi.count_participants`'s `list`, `ems.base.notify`'s `type` parameter, `datetime_utils`' `datetime` parameters). Check for it with `pylint --disable=all --enable=redefined-builtin models/` (installed via `apt install pylint`) — not wired into a blocking hook, run it by hand after any pass touching several files.
- XML `<record>`: `id` attribute before `model`.
- f-strings instead of `%s` formatting.
- **No em dash (—) as a decorative separator in user-facing/translatable text** (`_("...")` in Python, `_t("...")` in JS/OWL, view `string=` labels) — e.g. `"%(teacher)s — %(subject)s"`. Developer feedback (2026-08-10, working_schedules_import_wizard's grouped-conflict labels): use a plain hyphen (`-`) instead. An em dash used as genuine English grammar (setting off a parenthetical/interruptive clause, not just joining two short fields) is fine to keep - the rule is specifically about the decorative "A — B" join pattern, not em dashes in general prose.
- **DRY, both server (Python) and client (JS):** never duplicate code. Reuse existing methods, extend them, or extract a new shared method/RPC call instead of copy-pasting logic.
- **"Odoo way" first:** don't build a custom solution unless strictly necessary. Always check the official Odoo v18 documentation and existing Odoo/EMS patterns for a built-in mechanism before writing bespoke code.
- **Full-scenario exploration before implementing — never assume, ask when ambiguous.** Before writing or relaxing any validation/constraint/guard, grep and read *every* real write path for the field(s) it touches (every wizard, compute/onchange method, direct ORM call, view `required`/`readonly` attribute) — not just the one test or scenario currently in front of you. Don't guess whether a state that conflicts with a new check is a "legitimate real case" or merely a test fixture bypassing what the real UI/ORM would otherwise enforce — verify it by tracing the actual code paths, every one of them, before deciding which side (the new check, or the conflicting test/code) is wrong. If, after that exploration, genuine ambiguity remains — however small — ask the developer rather than picking a side. Found the hard way (2026-07-30): a new `sale.order` constraint broke an existing test, and the first fix relaxed the constraint on the unverified assumption that the test reflected a real production scenario; only the developer's follow-up question ("¿tiene sentido que esto ocurra? ¿se me escapa algo?") prompted the full write-path audit that should have happened *before* proposing that fix — which then showed the assumption was wrong (no real path can produce that state) and the test's fixture needed fixing instead, not the constraint. A relaxed-on-assumption constraint can silently end up less protective than intended, which is exactly the class of mistake this rule exists to prevent.
- Resulting code must be clean, simple, non-redundant, and well-refactored.
- **All literals must be translatable:** wrap every user-facing string for translation (`_("...")` in Python, `_t("...")` in JS/OWL) so it can be picked up by the i18n files, with English as the default/source language. Wrapping is only step one — it makes a string *translatable*, it does not translate it. Every new feature must also add the actual Catalan/Spanish entries to `i18n/ca_ES.po` and `i18n/es_ES.po` before it's considered done (see the "Close" step of the Development workflow below). To find what's missing: export current terms with `odoo -d ems --i18n-export=<path>.po -l ca_ES --modules=ems --stop-after-init` (repeat for `es_ES`), diff msgids against the checked-in `.po` files, and append translated blocks for the new ones only (don't regenerate/replace the whole file — order doesn't matter to gettext, and the files may already carry unrelated pre-existing gaps that aren't your task's responsibility). Run as the `odoo` user with a path it can write to (not a sandboxed/restricted directory). Do not insert decorative section-header comments between po entries — a comment block with no following `msgid` breaks Odoo's po parser on load.

  **A msgid diff alone is not enough — it misses reused labels.** Odoo's po loader binds a block's `msgstr` to the *exact* `#:` reference lines in that block (`model:ir.model.fields,field_description:ems.field_<model>__<field>`, `model:res.groups,name:ems.<xmlid>`, `model:ir.ui.menu,name:ems.<xmlid>`, `model:mail.template,subject/body_html/name:ems.<xmlid>`, etc.) — never by matching msgid text alone. So when a new field/record's label happens to be a common word already translated for a *different* field (`Teacher`, `Name`, `Active`, `Manager`, `Administrator`, `Configuration`, `Sequence`...), a msgid-only diff reports nothing missing — the text isn't new — yet the new field still renders untranslated, because its own `#:` reference was never added to that existing block. For every new field/model/group/menu/template introduced by the feature: search the checked-in `.po` for its exact label text first; if a block already exists, add your new record's `#:` reference to it (same `msgstr`, no translation work needed) instead of assuming it's already covered; only create a brand-new block if the text itself doesn't exist anywhere yet. **Verify, don't just trust the diff:** after `./upgrade.sh`, spot-check a sample of the new fields/records directly in the DB, e.g. `psql -c "SELECT field_description FROM ir_model_fields WHERE model='<model>' AND name='<field>';"` (or the equivalent column for `ir.model.name`, `ir.ui.menu.name`, `res.groups.name`, `mail.template.name`/`subject`/`body_html`, etc.), and confirm the jsonb value actually has `ca_ES`/`es_ES` keys, not just `en_US`. A `.po` entry existing is necessary but not sufficient — only a DB read proves the reference actually matched.

## Documentation structure

There are **two distinct categories** of documentation, for two different audiences — every new feature needs both, they are not alternatives:

- **Technical documentation** (`docs/en/developers/`): for developers reading the code. English only. Mermaid diagrams of hierarchy/relations, CRUD flow, access-control tables.
- **User documentation** (`docs/{en,ca,es}/<role>/`): manuals for the people who actually operate the feature in the running app — one folder per role (`admin`, `teachers`, `tutors`, `secretary`, `head_of_studies`, `families`). Trilingual: every user doc needs a Catalan, Spanish and English version. A single feature can need more than one role's manual (e.g. a teacher-facing screen plus the admin config behind it) — see the Development workflow below for how to identify which roles apply.

Trilingual tree: English (`docs/en/`), Catalan (`docs/ca/`), Spanish (`docs/es/`).

```
docs/
├── assets/            # Shared images (all languages reference this)
│   ├── families/
│   └── tutors/
├── en/
│   ├── admin/         # [USER doc] Administrator manuals
│   ├── developers/    # [TECHNICAL doc] Mermaid diagrams, CRUD flow, access-control tables (English only)
│   ├── families/      # [USER doc] Family/student manuals
│   ├── head_of_studies/  # [USER doc] Head of Studies / Deputy / Director manuals
│   ├── secretary/      # [USER doc] Secretariat manuals
│   ├── teachers/       # [USER doc] Teacher manuals
│   └── tutors/         # [USER doc] Group tutor manuals
├── ca/  (same structure, minus developers/ — user docs only, no technical docs in Catalan)
└── es/  (same structure, minus developers/ — user docs only, no technical docs in Spanish)
```

Folder names are always in English regardless of the language tree (`teachers/`, not `professors/`; `secretary/`, not `secretaria/`), so paths stay consistent across `en/`, `ca/` and `es/` — only the file contents and index labels are translated.

Image references in markdown use relative paths: `../../assets/<section>/filename.png`

**Screenshots must never expose real personal data (2026-08-06).** A real-instance screenshot
(list views especially) very easily includes other visible rows/records in the background —
student/teacher names, e-mails, etc. — not just the one thing the screenshot is meant to
illustrate. Before saving any screenshot into `docs/assets/`:
- Crop to the specific dialog/region the manual step actually needs (e.g. just the modal, not the
  full-window screenshot behind it) — this is usually enough on its own to exclude any background
  list content, and improves the screenshot's focus as a side effect.
- If personal data still can't be fully excluded by cropping alone (it's inside the region that
  actually needs to be shown), blur/pixelate it before saving.
- If you cannot verify a screenshot is clean (e.g. you generated it via an automated flow and
  didn't actually look at the result), do not save/reference it — either inspect it yourself first
  (read the image back before treating the task as done), or tell the developer exactly which file
  and region needs redaction and let them decide, rather than publishing it as-is.
This applies regardless of source: a tour-driven capture, a manual `Read` of a screenshot file, or
anything the developer hands you directly.

## Optional tooling: qmd for searching `docs/`/`plans/` (2026-08-10)

[qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) is a local, MIT-licensed hybrid search tool (BM25 + vector
+ LLM reranking, all on-device — no data leaves the machine, no API keys) that can index
`docs/` and `plans/` and expose an MCP server for "where is X documented?" style questions.

**This is opt-in per developer, not a project requirement.** It is not installed, configured,
or assumed to be present by default — nothing in this repo depends on it. It's mentioned here
purely so any Claude session opened on this repo knows the option exists and can offer to set
it up if the developer wants it, without anyone being forced to install anything.

**Where it actually helps, based on a real measurement of this project's own session history
(2026-08-10):** ~10.6% of all tool-result volume across this project's sessions was
`docs/`/`plans/` reads or doc-focused subagent dispatches; of that, the genuinely replaceable
slice (locating a fact across the doc corpus, as opposed to reading a file's current full
content because you're about to edit it) was estimated at roughly 3-6% of total tool-result
volume — modest, but real, and concentrated in exactly the "which doc covers this?" lookups
that recur throughout the Development workflow's D steps (Spec, Close) and DTON-era doc
audits.

**Where it does *not* help — confirmed, don't reach for it here:** Python/code search (grep/
Explore already give exact, deterministic matches; semantic similarity is a downgrade for
finding a symbol), merge conflict resolution (a git-history problem, not retrieval), test
output logs (ephemeral, want literal grep on a specific run, not a persistent semantic index),
and `changelog/` (the PR-delivery workflow always reads every file there in full and verbatim
— there's no "search a subset" step to accelerate, and the files are small already).

**If a developer wants to try it:** local install via Bun/Node (`bun install -g @tobilu/qmd` or
`npm install -g @tobilu/qmd`, Node ≥22 or Bun ≥1.0), then `qmd collection add ./docs --name
docs` + `qmd collection add ./plans --name plans` + `qmd embed` (downloads ~2GB of local GGUF
models on first run), then register it as an MCP server in their own **user-level** Claude Code
config — not `.mcp.json` in this repo, so it stays each developer's individual choice and never
prompts a colleague who hasn't opted in. Install note (hit on this box): `bun install -g` can
produce an ABI mismatch between Bun's own `better-sqlite3` build and qmd's native `sqlite-vec`
extension — `npm install -g @tobilu/qmd` avoided it. The `qmd` launcher itself still requires a
real `node` binary on `$PATH` regardless of which package manager installed it (it re-execs into
`node`/`bun` based on which lockfile shipped in the installed package, and its shebang line is
`#!/usr/bin/env node`) — Bun alone, without Node also installed, is not enough to run it.

**GPU acceleration matters here — check before writing this off as too slow to use.** The MCP
server only exposes the hybrid `query` tool (BM25 + vector + LLM reranking) — not the lighter
CLI-only `search`/`vsearch` modes — so every MCP-driven lookup pays the full reranking cost.
Measured on this box (an Incus/LXC container on a Ryzen 5000-series laptop): CPU-only, a single
`query` call took **~2-3 minutes** (reranking 36 chunks on 6 CPU math cores) — impractical for
interactive use. After passing the host's integrated GPU into the container (`AMD Radeon
Graphics (RADV RENOIR)` via Vulkan) and rebuilding embeddings on the GPU pipeline
(`qmd embed --force` — needed once, since vectors computed under CPU vs GPU inference differ
enough at the bit level that `qmd doctor` flags them as stale), the *same* query with *identical*
top result and score dropped to **~6 seconds**. If running inside a container without a GPU
passed through, checking whether one can be added is worth doing before concluding qmd is too
slow to bother with via MCP.

- **Incus/LXD** (what this box uses): `incus config device add <instance-name> gpu gpu` (or
  `lxc config device add ...` on plain LXD) from the host, then restart the instance — this must
  be run by whoever manages the host, not from inside the container. Inside the container,
  once `/dev/dri/renderD1xx` appears, install `mesa-vulkan-drivers` + `vulkan-tools` (verify with
  `vulkaninfo --summary`) and re-run `qmd doctor` to confirm `device probe: GPU vulkan`.
- **Plain LXC:** add `lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow: c 226:* rwm` and
  `lxc.mount.entry: /dev/dri/renderD128 dev/dri/renderD128 none bind,optional,create=file` to the
  container's config file, then restart it.
- Not relevant on bare metal or a VM with GPU passthrough already configured — this step is
  specifically for containerized dev environments (LXC/LXD/Incus/Docker) where the GPU isn't
  visible to the container by default.

## Design plans (`plans/`)

`plans/` (project root) holds **design plans for work that hasn't been implemented yet** —
e.g. a plan drafted in one session/branch to be executed later in a different one. It is
deliberately separate from `docs/`: it is not documentation of shipped behaviour, it's a
working note that becomes stale/obsolete the moment the described work either lands (at
which point the real `docs/en/developers/` + `docs/{en,ca,es}/<role>/` docs are what's
authoritative — fold anything still relevant from the plan into them and delete the plan
file) or gets superseded by a different approach.

- One file per plan, `plans/<short_topic>.md`, English.
- State at the top whether it's still current: a plan can go stale as the surrounding code
  moves on between when it was written and when someone picks it up — say so explicitly
  rather than letting a reader assume it's up to date.
- Not trilingual, not linked from any `index.md` — it's a working note, not a manual.
- Once the plan is implemented (or abandoned), delete the file rather than leaving a
  stale plan behind — `git log` still has it if anyone needs the history.

## Data folder conventions

The `data/` directory has three subfolders with different ID ownership semantics:

| Folder | ID prefix | Owned by | Survives EMS upgrade? |
|--------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|
| `data/main/` | `ems.` | EMS module | No — Odoo deletes on upgrade if removed from manifest |
| `data/cat/` | `ems.` | EMS module | No |
| `data/custom/` | `__import__.` | The centre (not EMS) | Yes — Odoo never deletes `__import__` records during module upgrades |

**Rule:** every record `id` in `data/custom/` must use the `__import__.` prefix. Records in `data/main/` and `data/cat/` must use `ems.` (or no prefix, which Odoo expands to `ems.` automatically).

**Exception — overriding a native Odoo record:** when a `data/custom/` record's `id` deliberately matches the XML ID of a record already shipped by a native Odoo module (e.g. `hr.dep_administration`, the default "Administration" department from the `hr` module, deactivated in `data/custom/hr.department.csv` instead of replaced), keep that module's own prefix (`hr.`, `base.`, etc.) instead of `__import__.`. Using `__import__.` there would create a *new* record instead of overriding the existing one.

**Exception — extending a `data/cat/` record with centre-specific data:** when a `data/custom/` record deliberately reuses the exact `ems.*` id of a record already declared in `data/cat/` to attach centre-specific data to it (e.g. `data/custom/ccff/ems.study.csv` re-declares `ems.study_cfgs_icb0_dam_2024` — already defined in `data/cat/ems.study.csv` — solely to add the centre's own optional subjects to `subject_ids`), keep the `ems.` prefix instead of `__import__.`. This is intentional: it's the same underlying record, updated in place, not a new one — every `ems.planning.*` file's `study_id` ref still needs to resolve to that single shared record. Using `__import__.` there would fork it into two disconnected studies. Only reuse an `ems.*` id like this when the intent really is "extend the shared `data/cat` record in place"; a `data/custom/` record that happens to duplicate `data/cat` content verbatim (not extending it, just repeating it) is a bug, not this exception — consolidate into one file instead (see the `product.category.csv` history in this repo for an example fix).

These two exceptions are the only cases where a non-`__import__.` prefix in `data/custom/` is correct — everywhere else it's a bug.

**Why `__import__`?** When Odoo stores a record with a fully-qualified ID whose module part is `__import__`, it is not associated with any installable module. This means removing the corresponding line from the manifest — or upgrading EMS — will never cause Odoo to delete that record. This is the same behaviour as data imported via the Odoo UI CSV importer, which also assigns `__import__.*` IDs.

**Precise mechanism, verified empirically 2026-07-30 (removed a row from an already-`__import__.`-prefixed CSV, ran `./upgrade.sh`, confirmed the DB record survived untouched; re-added the row, confirmed it re-linked to the same record, no duplicate) and by reading `odoo/addons/base/models/ir_model.py::_process_end`** — the method Odoo calls at the end of every module load to delete records whose xmlid vanished from the reloaded data:
```sql
SELECT ... FROM ir_model_data
WHERE module IN %(modules_being_processed)s AND COALESCE(noupdate, false) != true ...
```
Two independent conditions gate deletion, both need to hold: **(1)** the record's `ir_model_data.module` must be one of the modules actually being installed/updated in this run (e.g. `('ems',)`) — `__import__` is never in that set, so a `__import__`-owned record is never even a *candidate* for this cleanup, full stop, regardless of `noupdate`; **(2)** even for a module-owned record, `noupdate=True` also independently exempts it from deletion. This means deletion-safety and update-safety are two genuinely separate mechanisms that happen to both be governed by columns on the same `ir_model_data` row: `module='__import__'` is what makes a `data/custom/` record here survive being removed from its CSV file entirely; `noupdate` (deliberately `False` for `data/custom/`, see above) is what makes its *field values* keep tracking the file while the record itself still exists. **Removing a row from a `data/custom/` CSV and running `./upgrade.sh` does *not* delete the corresponding record — it just stops that field data from being pushed to it going forward.** If a record genuinely needs to be deleted, that has to be done explicitly (a migration script, or by hand) — the file alone can't do it once a record is `__import__`-owned.

**Rule — author new `data/` records as CSV, not XML, wherever the model allows it.** This is what makes the `__import__.` prefix rule above achievable at all (see the hard limitation below) — an XML `<record>` in `data/custom/` can *never* get a real `__import__.` id, so starting a new centre-specific dataset in XML guarantees this exact gap has to be paid down again later. Applies to teammates too, not just AI-assisted changes. CSV is only unusable for a genuine, confirmed technical reason (see the two confirmed blockers just below) — if in doubt whether a new dataset hits one of them, check first rather than defaulting to XML out of habit.

**Hard limitation #1 — `__import__.` only works in CSV, not XML `<record>` tags:** Odoo's XML data loader (`odoo/tools/convert.py::_test_xml_id`) unconditionally rejects any `<record id="module.name">` whose module isn't an *actually installed* Odoo module, and `__import__` never is — this raises `AssertionError: The ID "__import__.xxx" refers to an uninstalled module` and aborts the entire file's load. `__import__` is only accepted by the CSV/`load()` import path (`odoo/models.py`), which is why the UI CSV importer and CSV data files can use it but a `data/custom/*.xml` file cannot. There is no XML-side workaround for this one — a one2many populated inline via `eval="[(0, 0, {...})]"` (e.g. `ems.planning`'s `planning_outcome_ids`) needs a **separate related CSV file** (one row per child record, referencing its parent by id) instead of a 1:1 XML→CSV transliteration; CSV's `load()` path has no inline-eval equivalent. Don't attempt `id="__import__.xxx"` in a `<record>` tag — verify with `./upgrade.sh` after any id-prefix change in `data/custom/`.

**Confirmed real, remaining CSV-incompatible case — a field resolved via `search=`, not a static `ref=`.** `<field name="..." search="[(...)]"/>` runs an arbitrary domain lookup at load time to resolve a many2one that has no external id of its own (e.g. `data/custom/ccff/ems_enrollment_template_opt.xml`'s `product_id`, resolved via `[('product_tmpl_id.ems_subject_ids', '=', ref('__import__.subject_OPTn'))]` because the `product.product` variant is auto-generated by `ems.subject` and never gets its own xmlid). CSV's `load()` only supports a static `field/id` external-id reference or a plain value — there's no domain-search equivalent, and minting a brand-new xmlid for the resolved record doesn't fully work around it either: that new xmlid would have to exist *before* this CSV loads (it's what the row references), but it can only be created by code that itself needs the earlier-loaded data already in place — a chicken-and-egg ordering problem with no clean fix via `post_init_hook` (which runs after all data, too late for a file that references the id it would create). Files that only use `search=` for this reason stay in XML, without a `__import__.` id, as a deliberate, confirmed exception — not a gap to keep re-litigating; a real fix would need product-level changes (e.g. `ems.subject`'s own create() logic assigning its generated product an xmlid at creation time), out of scope for a `data/` format conversion.

**`data/custom/` is versioned config, not runtime state — embrace `noupdate=False`, matching `data/cat/`.** CSV loaded via the manifest's plain `data` key is always `noupdate=False` — every upgrade re-syncs the record's fields to match the file. This is deliberate and desired for `data/custom/`, exactly like `data/cat/` already works today (100% `noupdate=False`, whether CSV or the handful of XML files there): each centre's `data/custom/` is that centre's own versioned configuration (planning ponderations, authorization templates, course setup, etc.), the CSV file is its single source of truth, and re-applying it every upgrade is what lets one centre adopt another's fork by patching these files and running an upgrade — the same workflow already used for EMS's own shared `data/cat/` content. An admin's in-app edit to a `data/custom/`-backed record (e.g. editing a planning's ponderations from its form view) is expected to be reverted on the next upgrade unless it's also committed to the CSV — that's the contract, not a bug.

**Exception — a `data/custom/` model can be genuinely *living* data instead of config.** The
rule above assumes every `data/custom/` record is centre configuration the file should keep
owning. Some models don't fit that: their fields are day-to-day operational data an admin
manages *through the running app* during the year (renaming a group, reassigning a classroom,
correcting an employee's phone number) — not something a developer edits in the file and
commits. For those, the CSV must seed the record once and then be permanently ignored, exactly
like an XML `noupdate="1"` record, regardless of format. Found 2026-09-06 on `ems.group` (a
renamed group or reassigned classroom, `space_id`, was silently reverted by the next
`./upgrade.sh`) and fixed by freezing the record's own `ir_model_data.noupdate` flag directly via
code (`res.company._ems_freeze_living_custom_data()`, called from `_register_hook()`) — CSV can
never carry `noupdate=True` via the file itself (see the capability table below). See
`docs/en/developers/shared/data_loading.md`'s "`data/custom/` living data" section for the full
mechanism and the test used to tell living data from master config, and
[[project_data_custom_living_vs_master_audit]] in memory for which other `data/custom/` models
are suspected of the same gap (audit pending developer review, not yet fixed).

**CSV cannot actually be marked `noupdate=True` in this Odoo version — that's exclusive to XML.** An earlier version of this note claimed the deprecated `init_xml` manifest key gives a CSV file `noupdate=True`; that was wrong and has been corrected after a live test (2026-07-30, `data/custom/res.partner.category-<probe>.csv` listed under `'init_xml': [...]`, ran `./upgrade.sh`) showed the file never even loaded — no "loading ems/..." log line, record never created. Root cause, confirmed by reading the actual installed `odoo/modules/loading.py::load_data._get_files_of_kind`: `keys = ['init_xml', 'update_xml', 'data']` is set inside an `elif kind == 'data':` branch, but the very next line, `if isinstance(kind, str): keys = [kind]`, is a **separate, unconditional `if`, not an `elif`** — since `kind` is always a plain string, this second `if` always fires and silently overwrites `keys` back down to just `['data']`, discarding the `init_xml`/`update_xml` merge entirely. Files listed under `init_xml`/`update_xml` are therefore never read at all during the normal 'data' load phase in this Odoo build, regardless of noupdate — apparent dead code, not a working (if deprecated) mechanism. The only manifest key that actually produces `noupdate=True` is `demo` — semantically wrong for real config (demo data is optional, skipped entirely with `--without-demo`, and conceptually sample data, not a centre's real configuration). **Practical conclusion: if a `data/custom/` (or any EMS) CSV record genuinely needs `noupdate=True` protection, there is no clean file-based way to get it — the only options are (a) keep it XML, or (b) set `ir_model_data.noupdate=True` directly via a migration script**, bypassing the file-loading mechanism's noupdate handling entirely (not something to reach for casually, since it also means the file's own content stops being an honest description of what the record actually does on upgrade).

**Critical, easy-to-miss detail when converting an existing `noupdate="1"` XML file to CSV: the file's load-time `noupdate` context is not what decides whether an *already-existing* record gets updated — `ir_model_data.noupdate`, a value stored per-record at the time it was first created, is.** Confirmed empirically 2026-07-30 (edited a value in an already-`__import__.`-renamed CSV row and ran a plain `./upgrade.sh`; nothing changed) and by reading `odoo/models.py::_load_records`: `if not (update and d_noupdate): to_update.append(data)` reads `d_noupdate` from the **existing** `ir_model_data` row, not from the noupdate the calling file was loaded with. A record originally created under `<data noupdate="1">` XML has `True` permanently baked into that stored column — converting its file to CSV and even renaming its `module` to `__import__` changes nothing about whether it gets updated, because the stored flag still says "don't touch me." **A rename migration must explicitly clear it**: `UPDATE ir_model_data SET module = '__import__', noupdate = FALSE WHERE ...` — not just the module column (see `migrations/18.0.0.22.0/pre-migrate.py::_rename_data_custom_xmlid_ownership` for the fixed pattern; the earlier `18.0.0.19.1` rename for `ems.group`/`crm.team` didn't need this because those files were always plain CSV, never noupdate=1 XML, so their stored flag was already `False`). Verify with the same empirical test used here — change a value in the converted CSV, run a plain `./upgrade.sh` (no version forcing), confirm the DB actually picked it up — rather than trusting that "it's CSV now" is sufficient on its own.

**Gotcha confirmed while converting `ems.course.xml`: a legacy NULL boolean can't self-heal via CSV resync.** A Boolean field added to a model *after* some rows already existed leaves those rows' column raw SQL NULL forever, unless something explicitly backfills it — Odoo's own `Boolean.convert_to_cache` does `bool(None) == False`, so the ORM (including the CSV loader's own read-current-value-before-deciding-to-write step) can never tell a legacy NULL apart from a real `False`. Converting the file from `noupdate="1"` XML to `noupdate=False` CSV does **not** fix this on its own: the loader sees "current value False (really NULL), desired value False" as no change and skips the `write()`, so the NULL survives every future upgrade untouched — confirmed on `ems_course.is_enrollment_default` (one legacy row, backfilled explicitly via `migrations/18.0.0.22.0/post-migrate.py::_backfill_null_course_enrollment_default`, not something the format conversion itself could resolve). Before converting any `noupdate="1"` file whose model has Boolean fields, spot-check `col IS NULL` (not just the ORM-friendly `SELECT col`, which masks it) on the existing production data and add an explicit one-time SQL backfill in the same migration if any legacy NULLs turn up.

**The one real exception: fields that are live application state, not configuration.** A field a running EMS instance mutates itself as part of normal operation (not a one-off admin edit) must **not** be a synced CSV column at all, or every upgrade breaks that operation — e.g. `ems.course.is_current`/`is_enrollment_default`, flipped by `res.company._sync_current_course_flag()` whenever the "Current course" setting changes, or `ir.sequence.number_next_actual` (never a data-file column in the first place, for the same reason). Leave such fields out of the CSV entirely — the record still gets `__import__.`-prefixed and survives upgrades/module removal like every other `data/custom/` row, it just isn't re-seeded from the file after its first creation for that specific field. Seed the field's actual initial value (if not the model's plain default) via a one-time `post_init_hook`/migration write instead, same pattern as any other one-time backfill (see "Migrations" below). This is a narrow, field-level carve-out, not a reason to keep a whole record/file in XML or under a different noupdate policy.

**Deciding `noupdate=True` vs `False` for `data/main/`/`data/cat/` (EMS's own data, not `data/custom/`'s centre config): default to `False` — EMS owns its data and should keep improving it. `noupdate=True` is the exception, earned per record, not a default courtesy** — and being Odoo-native vs EMS-authored has no bearing on the decision either way (Odoo's own official docs leave this entirely to each module's judgment, and Odoo core itself is inconsistent about it). The actual test, and worked examples (`ems.schedule_framework_default.xml` genuinely earns `noupdate=True`; `ems.mail_activity_type.xml`/`res.partner.category.xml` don't): see `docs/en/developers/shared/data_loading.md`'s "Deciding `noupdate=True` vs `False`" section.

**Load order:** within `data/custom/`, always list files so that referenced records are declared before the files that reference them (e.g. `ems.subject.csv` before `ems.study.csv`).

## Migrations

**Every change must work on both paths: a brand-new clean install and an upgrade of an already-existing installation.** These are two different Odoo code paths and neither implies the other:
- **Clean install** (`-i ems` on a database that has never had EMS): manifest `data`/`demo` files load, then `post_init_hook` (defined in `__init__.py`) runs once. Migration scripts under `migrations/` never run on a clean install — there is no "previous version" to migrate from.
- **Upgrade of an existing install** (`-u ems`, what `./upgrade.sh` runs): `pre-migrate.py`/`post-migrate.py` under `migrations/<version>/` run (only if the module's stored version differs from the manifest's), then `data` files reload. `post_init_hook` does **not** run again on upgrade — it already ran when that installation was first created.
- Any one-time setup action that isn't captured by a versioned data file (e.g. enabling a PostgreSQL extension, backfilling a column, deduplicating rows) needs **both**: the logic in `post_init_hook` for installations created from now on, and the equivalent in a `migrations/<version>/post-migrate.py` (or `pre-migrate.py`, see below) for installations that already exist and will upgrade into this version. Skipping either one means one class of environment silently never gets the fix — see `_backfill_default_schedule_framework`/`_enable_unaccent_extension` in `__init__.py` alongside their `migrations/18.0.0.20.0`, `18.0.0.21.0`, `18.0.0.22.0` `post-migrate.py` counterparts for the established pattern.
- When testing locally, remember `./upgrade.sh` only exercises the upgrade path (this box already has EMS installed) — it never re-runs `post_init_hook`. Verifying the clean-install path requires actually installing on a fresh database (or at minimum, code review confirming the same logic exists in both places).

Any change that alters or renames something Odoo identifies by **XML ID** — records, fields backing a reified view, etc. — on an environment where that XML ID may already exist in production (i.e. it isn't brand new in this branch) must ship with a migration script under `migrations/<version>/{pre,post}-migrate.py`, following the existing examples in that folder (e.g. `migrations/18.0.0.18.0/pre-migrate.py`, which renames `ems.level` view/action/menu XML IDs via `UPDATE ir_model_data`).

**Why:** renaming an XML ID in the source (e.g. `security/groups.xml`'s `<record id="group_admin">` → `<record id="group_academic_admin">`) without a matching migration means Odoo won't find the old ID on upgrade, creates a brand-new record for the new ID, and can leave the original record — along with any data attached to it in production (e.g. a `res.groups` with real users assigned) — orphaned or deleted. Applying the fix by hand in one environment (e.g. via `odoo shell`, as done for `group_admin` → `group_academic_admin`) does **not** carry over to other environments; production still needs the migration script to apply the same fix when it upgrades.

**How to apply:** before renaming/removing an XML ID, check whether it already exists in the target production database (assume yes unless the record was introduced earlier in the same unreleased branch). If so, add a `pre-migrate.py` under `migrations/<manifest version>/` that renames it at the DB level (`UPDATE ir_model_data SET name = '<new>' WHERE module = 'ems' AND name = '<old>'`) before the module's data files reload. Use `pre-migrate` (not `post-migrate`) so the rename happens before Odoo's data loader tries to resolve the new ID. Never bump the manifest version yourself to create the migration folder — per the rule above, propose it and wait for user go-ahead first.

**`pre-migrate.py` vs `post-migrate.py` — know what exists at each point:** `pre-migrate` runs *before* Odoo syncs the module's schema/data for this version (new columns/tables from the model definitions do not exist yet; XML data from `data/`/`views/` has not reloaded yet). `post-migrate` runs *after* — schema and data are already in their new-version state. Concretely:
- A column backing a field **introduced in this same version** does not exist during `pre-migrate` — referencing it there fails with `UndefinedColumn`/`column "..." does not exist`. Any backfill of a new field (e.g. seeding a new required field before Odoo enforces `NOT NULL`) belongs in **`post-migrate`**, never `pre-migrate` — "before the constraint is enforced" refers to Odoo's own internal ALTER TABLE step, which already happens automatically between pre and post; it is not an instruction to run the backfill as early as possible.
- Renaming an **existing** XML ID (the case above) belongs in **`pre-migrate`**, precisely because it must happen before the data loader tries to resolve the new name against old data — the opposite situation from a brand-new field.
- Rule of thumb: if the migration script references a field/column/table that is *new* in this version's models, it goes in `post-migrate`. If it operates on something that already existed before this version (renames, data transforms on pre-existing columns), it goes in `pre-migrate`.
- **Refinement, confirmed empirically 2026-09-06:** the rule of thumb above assumes plain `cr.execute()`. A script that instead builds an `env = api.Environment(cr, SUPERUSER_ID, {})` and reads/writes through the ORM (field access, `action_archive()`, any model method) needs **`post-migrate`** even when every field it touches is old, pre-existing schema — confirmed by `migrations/18.0.0.23.4/post-migrate.py`'s `_archive_departed_teacher_calendars` (a data-consistency backfill on `hr.employee.active`/`resource.calendar.employee_id`/`active`, none of them new that version) failing in `pre-migrate` with `AttributeError: 'resource.calendar' object has no attribute 'employee_id'` — the registry `pre-migrate` scripts run against isn't fully set up yet, even for a field that's been in the model for months. Only a script using raw SQL throughout (like the XML-ID rename above) can safely live in `pre-migrate`; the moment ORM access is needed, use `post-migrate` regardless of column age.
- Test this locally with `./upgrade.sh` from the actual pre-upgrade DB state before shipping — a migration script that only gets exercised for the first time in production is exactly how this class of bug (`migrations/18.0.0.20.0/pre-migrate.py` initially referencing the new `default_schedule_framework_id` column) reached production undetected: the `/deploy-check` dry-run that should have caught it never actually loaded the `ems` module at all due to an unrelated bug in `deploy-check.yml`'s `addons_path` — don't rely on `/deploy-check` alone; a clean upgrade there is not proof the migration scripts ran.

**Merging/rebasing across branches that each add migration scripts:** when two branches developed in parallel each add a `migrations/<version>/{pre,post}-migrate.py`, a naive merge can silently strand one branch's script in an already-released version folder instead of the current unreleased one (exactly what happened when `migrations/18.0.0.20.1/post-migrate.py` was added by a feature branch merged after `18.0.0.20.1` had already been tagged/released — the script would never run on any environment that had already upgraded past that tag). Before finishing any merge that touches `migrations/`: (1) check `git tag` for the most recent released version and confirm every new/changed migration script lives under a version folder *higher* than that tag; (2) if two branches each created their own `migrations/<same-current-version>/{pre,post}-migrate.py`, merge their `migrate()` bodies into one file (e.g. as separate helper functions called from a single `migrate()`) rather than keeping duplicate files or silently dropping one side's script — Odoo only runs one `pre-migrate.py`/`post-migrate.py` per version folder.

## Resolving merge conflicts

When resolving a merge conflict, never pick a side (ours/theirs) blindly. Before resolving each conflicted hunk:

- Inspect the commit tree around the conflict (`git log --graph --oneline` for both branches, `git log <branch>..<other-branch>`, `git diff`/`git show` on the relevant commits) to understand what each side actually changed and why.
- Confirm the resolution keeps every change from both sides that is still relevant — don't silently drop a change just because it's on the losing side of a textual conflict.
- If, after this review, it's still unclear which change should prevail or how to combine them, ask the user instead of guessing.

## DTON cleaning methodology (historical — retroactive backlog completed 2026-07-29)

This was the retroactive code-quality process applied model by model, one phase at a time
(tracked in memory as `project_dton_rollout_roadmap`), followed by a refactor/test-
optimization pass (`project_post_dton_refactor_roadmap`). **Every model in EMS now has DTON
applied — there is no backlog left.** This section is kept so the D/T/O/N terminology below
stays defined and so the history is discoverable; the trigger rule it used to carry ("apply
DTON to any not-yet-covered model you're about to touch") has no live targets anymore. Going
forward, use the **Development workflow** below for both new models and changes to existing
ones — it already folds D/T/O/N into a single cycle and doesn't need a separate retroactive
pass to catch up to.

1. **D — Diagrams:** Technical docs in English (`docs/en/developers/`) with Mermaid diagrams; user docs in all three languages, one file per role that actually interacts with the feature (`docs/{en,ca,es}/<role>/`, where `<role>` is `admin`, `teachers`, `tutors`, `secretary`, `head_of_studies` or `families` — not only `admin/`; a feature can be relevant to more than one role and then needs a doc file under each).
2. **T — Testing:** Backend `TransactionCase` tests + browser tour test. The tour must exercise **every view where the model's data is actually rendered**, not just its own canonical list/kanban/form action — a clean `./upgrade.sh` and passing `TransactionCase` tests only prove the arch loads and the model's logic works; neither renders anything in a browser, so neither catches a client-side (OWL template, widget) crash. Concretely, check for and cover:
   - The model's own primary list/kanban/form views (the ones reachable from its normal menu).
   - Any **secondary view** for the same model reachable only via a different action (e.g. a kanban view inherited/overridden separately from the model's main list+form action) — these are easy to forget precisely because they're not in the model's own menu.
   - Any **other model's view that embeds this model's fields** — a `many2many_tags`/custom widget showing this model's records on a *different* model's form or kanban (e.g. `ems.role` colors rendered as badges on `hr.employee`'s form), a related/computed field surfacing this model's data elsewhere, etc. Grep for the model's name and its fields across `views/` before assuming the model's own screens are the full picture.
3. **O — Optimization:** `_order`, `_sql_constraints`, view fixes, computed field guards, refactoring, cleaner and simple code.
4. **N — Normalization:** Apply Odoo v18 official coding guidelines.

Gate O and N with `./test.sh TestClassName` for the model being cleaned (see "The full test suite is slow" above); ask before running the full, unscoped `./test.sh`, after N rather than after both phases.

## Development workflow (TDD + DTON)

The standard workflow for **any** change — a brand-new model/feature, or a modification to an
already-DTON-compliant one — so it arrives (or stays) DTON-compliant instead of needing a
separate cleanup pass later. It is TDD's Red-Green-Refactor cycle, with D/O/N slotted into it —
no separate process to remember, and no distinction between "new" and "existing" beyond
whether Spec/Red start from a blank file or a diff:

1. **Spec (before Red) — D:** Before any test or code, stub or update `docs/en/developers/<area>/<model>.md` (Mermaid diagram of hierarchy/relations, CRUD flow, access-control table) with the requirements this change needs to cover. From that access-control table, identify **every role that will actually use the feature** (`admin`, `teachers`, `tutors`, `secretary`, `head_of_studies`, `families` — a feature is frequently relevant to more than one, e.g. a teacher-facing grading screen plus an admin config screen) and stub or update one `docs/{en,ca,es}/<role>/<model>.md` per role identified, not just `admin/`. These stubs are the acceptance criteria for the cycle below.
2. **Red — T:** Write or adapt `tests/test_<model>.py` (`TransactionCase`) and the tour (`static/tests/tours/<model>_tour.js` + `tests/test_<model>_tour.py`) for the behavior this change needs — before writing the implementation. The tour is the default, not an optional extra; skip it only for a model with no UI surface at all (pure backend/abstract model, never rendered in any view). The tour must cover every view the model's data ends up in, including secondary views under a different action and any embedding in another model's view — not only the model's own screen. **This applies just as much to a change on an already-DTON'd model as to a brand-new one** — found the hard way (2026-07-30): a checkbox-to-radio widget change on `ems.limesurvey_block` was initially shipped without a tour ("no tour exists for this view" was treated as a reason to move on, not as the gap it was); the developer had to ask "¿no haría falta un tour para comprobar que abrir esta vista no falla?" before one got added — and it caught real, non-trivial bugs in the process (`select` on a plain `<select>` doesn't work the way it looks like it should, since Odoo's `SelectionField` JSON-stringifies the option `value` attribute — use `selectByLabel` instead; a `widget="code"` field is an Ace editor, not a plain `<textarea>`, and needs `ace.edit(anchor).setValue(...)` in a custom `run()`, not the generic `edit` action). `./upgrade.sh` succeeding only proves the view's XML is structurally valid (fields exist, widgets are compatible with the field type) — it proves nothing about whether the page actually renders or a click actually works in a real browser. `./test.sh TestClassName` (scoped to the relevant test class) must fail.
3. **Green — T:** Write the minimum code to pass: `models/<area>/<model>.py`, `security/ir.model.access.csv` (+ `security/rules/*.xml` if needed), `views/<area>/<model>/{form,list,menu}.xml`, manifest bump. `./test.sh TestClassName` must pass. If a new validation/constraint conflicts with an existing test, don't relax the new check to fit the test on assumption alone — see "Full-scenario exploration before implementing" in Coding standards above.
4. **Refactor — O:** In the same cycle, not as a later pass: add `_order`, `_sql_constraints`, computed field guards, view fixes for *this* model. Also check for **cross-cutting duplication** while you're here — the same shape of code (or test fixture/mock boilerplate) hand-written in more than one file is worth extracting into a shared helper (`ems.base` for production code, `tests/common.py` for test utilities) rather than left copy-pasted; this is exactly how the same escaping bug got independently found and fixed five times before `EmsBase.build_html_list` existed. Don't go looking for unrelated duplication elsewhere in the codebase on every change — but if this change's own work reveals an existing duplicate, fold the extraction into this same cycle instead of deferring it.
5. **Normalize — N:** Apply the Odoo v18 coding guidelines from the "Coding standards" section above — model attribute order, alphabetical imports, f-strings, loop variable naming, translatable literals, no shadowed builtins. Run `pylint --disable=all --enable=redefined-builtin` on the files you touched (see "Coding standards" above for the full command) — cheap, and this exact bug class (`list`, `type`, `datetime`, `bytes`/`hash` shadowing builtins) has recurred often enough to be worth a mechanical check rather than relying on reading alone.
6. **Gate:** `./upgrade.sh` and `./test.sh TestClassName` after each Red-Green-Refactor-Normalize cycle (see "The full test suite is slow" above — don't reach for the unscoped `./test.sh` here).
7. **Close — D:** For every role identified in the Spec step, fill in (or update) the three language versions of that role's user doc (`docs/{en,ca,es}/<role>/<model>.md`) — this is a mandatory deliverable of every change with a user-facing effect, not an optional extra to be requested separately; skipping it because the change "isn't for admins" is the most common way this step gets missed. Also update the role's `index.md` to link the manual if it's new. Add the new/changed strings' real Catalan/Spanish translations to `i18n/ca_ES.po` and `i18n/es_ES.po` (see "All literals must be translatable" above — wrapping in `_()`/`_t()` during Green/Refactor is not enough on its own), and reconcile the developer doc's diagram if the implementation diverged from the initial spec during the cycle. Finish by asking whether to run the full, unscoped `./test.sh` as the final gate for the whole change (see "Ask before launching the full, unscoped `./test.sh`" above — CI runs it anyway before merge). Then deliver the PR changelog summary described below — it's part of Close, not a separate ask.

   **Defer the full user-doc pass — and especially screenshots — while the feature is still under active design iteration in the same conversation (developer feedback 2026-08-10):** found while doing exactly this on the working-schedules import wizard — several small, still-evolving design tweaks in a row (a screen's position, its name, its own technical `state` key, then per-screen intro text) each triggered their own full Close step, rewriting the same admin-manual prose repeatedly for what was really one feature the developer hadn't yet confirmed as final. Screenshots are the expensive part to redo (capture, crop, verify no personal data leaked, re-crop); prose is cheaper but still wasted effort when the next message changes the same paragraph again. **How to apply:** keep the Spec-time *stub* current every cycle (already the rule above, and cheap either way), and keep the developer-facing English dev doc (`docs/en/developers/...`) current every cycle too (plain text, no screenshots, and it's the running record of *why*, needed to explain each iteration's own reasoning while it's still fresh) — but hold off writing the *full* three-language user-doc content and any screenshots until the developer actually confirms the feature has reached its final shape (a clear signal like "ya está", or simply moving on to unrelated work without more tweaks), then do one real Close pass covering everything that changed since the stub. If a change is genuinely a one-shot (no back-and-forth expected), there's no "still iterating" state to wait out — do the full Close immediately as before. When unsure whether more iteration is coming, ask rather than guessing which side to default to.

   **Track every deferred Close-step obligation proactively once it's been deferred — don't rely on being reminded (developer feedback 2026-08-11):** deferring the screenshot/full-doc pass above, or pushing the full unscoped `./test.sh` gate to "later, once confirmed," is fine — but once deferred, it must stay tracked as a live, explicit item (e.g. via the `TodoWrite` tool) for the rest of the session, not just left as prose inside this file or a memory/plan file to be re-discovered later. Real incident: after finishing a feature (a new wizard screen, tested and working), the developer asked "¿qué nos queda de este trabajo?" — the answer covered an unrelated plan-file audit but omitted that the full test gate had never been run and the screenshot-inclusive doc close was still outstanding, both already known to be deferred. The developer had to point out both themselves: *"te has olvidado de lo que quedaba pendiente... que esto no vuelva a pasar, por favor. Si te pregunto que queda pendiente, deberías saberlo si esto ya se ha hecho o no."* **How to apply:** the moment a Close-step item is deliberately deferred, add it to the todo list right then, not after the fact. When asked "what's left/pending" in any phrasing, check that tracked state first, before answering from memory/plan files alone — the answer should reflect what you already know is outstanding, not require the developer to notice a gap you already knew about.

## PR changelog: persist silently, deliver only on request

The developer keeps the chat in Spanish but writes their GitHub PR description in English,
using `.github/pull_request_template.md`'s sections (`Breaking changes` / `What's new` /
`Changes` / `Fixes` / `Internal changes` / `Related with`).

**No automatic chat delivery per task (retired 2026-07-30 — an earlier version of this rule
had the agent post an English block after every finished task; the developer simplified it
away since the persisted file below makes that unnecessary).** Instead: whenever a piece of
work finishes — a gap fix, a migration, a DTON cycle, anything the developer would want in the
PR body — silently append it to `changelog/<current-branch-name>.md` (e.g.
`changelog/284-dton-....md`; create the file, with real `#` section headings matching
`.github/pull_request_template.md`, if it doesn't exist yet). No chat output for this at task
completion — just the file write. (The separate "notify when a task finishes" bridge in
`/mnt/claude-notify/`, described elsewhere in this doc, is unrelated and unaffected — that
notification still fires normally.)

**Per-item formatting when writing to the file:** the item's own descriptive title directly as
the `##` heading (no "Item 1:"/"Item 2:" prefix, despite the template file's own placeholder
text), **ending that heading line with a colon**, no em dash (—) in the title as a separator
(parentheses instead) — e.g. `## Portal IBAN renewal (bank account never trusted):`. Group
items under their matching section (`# Fixes`, `# Internal changes`, etc.); a later item under
a section already present is appended under that existing heading, not a new one. Plain
markdown throughout, no code fences — the file is meant to be copied as a whole.

**Deliver only when explicitly asked** — trigger phrases like "dame el texto/los detalles para
la PR" or similar (ask for clarification if genuinely ambiguous, don't guess). When asked: read
**every** file currently under `changelog/` (not just the current branch's own — after pulling in
a colleague's branch there may be several). This can be asked at any point, not only right before
publishing — always return whatever has accumulated so far.

**Reassemble by section, in the PR template's order — never just concatenate the files as-is.**
Each individual `changelog/<branch>.md` file already groups its own items by section internally,
but its own top-level section order reflects whatever order that branch happened to add items in
(e.g. `Fixes` before `Breaking changes`), not `.github/pull_request_template.md`'s mandated order
(`Breaking changes` → `What's new` → `Changes` → `Fixes` → `Internal changes` → `Related with`).
Simply concatenating several files' raw content therefore produces a document with the same
section header repeated out of order several times over - wrong, and the developer will reject it
(confirmed 2026-08-12: *"No has respetado el orden de secciones que aparece en la plantilla de la
PR. Ese orden debe respetarse."*). Before delivering, parse every file's own top-level `# Section:`
blocks and re-group them: emit each of the 6 template sections exactly once, in the template's own
order, with every source file's items for that section folded in underneath it (preserving each
file's own item order within the section - a plain regex split on `^# ` headers per file, keyed by
the normalized section name, is enough; a short throwaway Python script is the fastest reliable
way to do this for a large combined document, rather than hand-reordering it inline).

**Omit any section with no items — never emit an empty `# Section` heading** (developer feedback
2026-09-02). The 6 template sections are the full set of *possible* headings, not a fixed skeleton
every PR must show in full; a branch with no breaking changes and no plain "Changes" simply has no
`# Breaking changes`/`# Changes` heading at all in the delivered document. Only emit a heading when
at least one item was folded into it.

**Don't append the "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code]" footer to this delivered document**
(developer feedback 2026-09-02) — that attribution line is for an actual PR description created
via `gh pr create`, not for the changelog draft handed over as a scratchpad file for the developer
to paste into GitHub themselves. Add it only if the developer explicitly asks for it here, or when
this session itself runs `gh pr create`.

**`Related with`: generate it from the merge history, don't omit it (changed 2026-09-01 - an
earlier version of this rule had the agent omit the section entirely and leave it for the
developer to fill in by hand; the developer asked for it to be generated instead, from the same
merge history used to catch the gap below).** Every branch merged into the current one is named
`<issue_number>-<slug>` (e.g. `373-head-of-studies-hierarchy-fix`); find them with
`git log --merges --oneline $(git merge-base main HEAD)..HEAD` (not just `main..HEAD` - use the
merge-base explicitly, since the current branch may itself be ahead of a stale local `main`), read
the issue number off the front of each `Merge branch '<n>-...'` line, and emit one
`- Closes #<n>` per issue, ascending. **Cross-check the resulting issue list against
`changelog/` before delivering** - a merged branch with no matching `changelog/<n>-*.md` file is a
gap, not something to silently drop from `Related with` (found this exact gap 2026-09-01: issue
#375 had merged in but never got a changelog entry). Don't just add the bare `Closes #375` and move
on - inspect what that merge actually changed (`git show --stat <merge_commit>`, then the real diff
underneath it) and write the missing `changelog/<n>-*.md` file too, in the same style as the
others, before folding it into the delivered document - otherwise the PR body's `Related with`
would reference a fix that its own `What's new`/`Fixes`/etc. sections never mention.

**Condense at delivery time - titles concise, bullets generic, similar items across different
models merged into one.** The per-branch working files stay exactly as detailed as they already
are (developer feedback 2026-08-12: *"Si a ti te va bien que los .md temporales sean tan
detallados, puedes hacer el resumen en el momento de fusionar los .md"* - the verbose,
model/field-naming style is fine and wanted for `changelog/<branch>.md` itself, since that's the
working record of *why* a decision was made, read by nobody but this session and the developer
mid-branch). It is **only the combined document handed to the developer for the actual PR body**
that must be condensed, per the same feedback (*"los títulos han de ser claros y concisos, y el
detalle que se muestra en forma de lista, también debe ser más resumido. No es necesario que se
nombren todos los modelos o campos, se puede hacer una descripción genérica... si varios títulos
tienen similitudes o hablan del mismo concepto pero de un modelo distinto, se pueden agrupar y
explicar de forma genérica"*):
- Rewrite each `##` title to be short and immediately clear on its own, dropping specific
  model/method/field names unless the title is meaningless without one.
- Rewrite each bullet to 1-3 sentences of plain, generic description - what changed and why it
  matters to whoever reads the PR, not how it was implemented or which exact fields/classes were
  touched. Drop the developer-quote/date/iteration trail entirely (useful in the working file's own
  history, noise in a PR body).
- **Merge titles across different files that describe the same underlying concept applied to
  different models/screens** into one generic entry - the canonical example found this same day:
  ~20 separate "`<model X>` now has its first browser tour" items (one per screen) collapse into a
  single "Browser-tour coverage added across most of the application" entry naming the *categories*
  of screens covered, not each one by name. The same merging applies to any other repeated pattern
  (e.g. several distinct course-transition data-integrity fixes found during the same rehearsal
  can be one bullet, not one heading each).
- This is a genuine rewrite, not a mechanical trim - read the full detailed content first (already
  required by the "read every file" step above), then write fresh, short prose that captures what a
  PR reviewer actually needs to know from it.

**No manual line wraps within a paragraph/bullet in the final delivered document — each one
must be a single continuous line in the file** (developer feedback 2026-09-04: *"Este texto de
PR tiene saltos de linea manuales? No debes hacer eso."*). This applies specifically to the
final reassembled/condensed PR document handed to the developer, not to the per-branch
`changelog/<branch>.md` working files themselves - those are fine hard-wrapped at a fixed
column width, since that's simply how the working file happens to be formatted while it's being
built up over the branch's lifetime.

**Deliver as a file, not pasted into chat — this developer's client renders no download
affordance either way** (`SendUserFile` produces no visible card in this VSCode-extension/Claude
Code environment, confirmed 2026-08-12 - only pasting is the actual regression to avoid). Write
the reassembled, section-ordered result to a single `.md` in the session scratchpad and tell the
developer the plain absolute path, with an explicit note to use **Ctrl+O (Open File), not Ctrl+P**
- a scratchpad path lives outside the open workspace, so Quick Open won't find it. Never copy it
into the actual project directory (an untracked file sitting in the repo is something the
developer would have to remember to delete before their next commit - confirmed unwanted,
2026-08-12). A `vscode://file/<path>` markdown link was tried the same day and did not render as
clickable in this client - don't bother with it, the plain-path-plus-Ctrl+O handoff is what
actually works here. Generating the full combined text as a chat response is also simply slow to
stream for a multi-thousand-word document - a second, independent reason to prefer the file.

**One file per branch, not one shared file** — deliberate, not just tidiness: every developer's
own Claude session does the same on their own branch, so `changelog/` ends up with multiple
independently-named files (one per contributor). A single shared file would conflict on every
merge between two branches that both touched it; separate, uniquely-named files never collide,
and simply accumulate side by side when branches are combined. **This folder must be tracked by
git** (not gitignored) so it survives a branch switch/pull-from. **Delete the entire
`changelog/` folder as the very last step before merging into `main`** (its contents are a
working draft, not permanent documentation — same lifecycle as a `plans/` file) once they've
been copied into the actual GitHub PR description.

**This deletion step is enforced and automated, not left to memory** (2026-07-30) — three
CI pieces work together:
- `.github/workflows/require-changelog-clean.yml`: a required status check on PRs targeting
  `main` that fails while `changelog/` still has any content, blocking the merge button.
- `.github/workflows/changelog-clean.yml`: comment `/changelog-clean` on the PR (same
  Integrators-team authorization as `/deploy-check`) to remove `changelog/` via an automated
  commit pushed to the PR's own branch, right before merging.
- `.github/workflows/ci-unit-testing.yml`: detects when a push only touched `changelog/` (the
  cleanup commit above) and skips its own expensive install/test steps for that run, so the
  cleanup doesn't trigger a full ~6-minute re-run — while still actually running (fast) and
  reporting a real result, deliberately not using `[skip ci]` or a path-filtered trigger for
  this, both of which risk GitHub leaving a required check stuck "pending" forever instead of
  passing.
