// Covers the two-stage leaving lifecycle (#388) as it is rendered on the student form
// (views/community/contact/form.xml): the scheduled-deactivation banner with its
// "Cancel scheduled deactivation" button, and - once the account is suspended - the
// scheduled-deletion banner with its confirm-guarded "Delete Google account" button.
// Both are driven by date fields rather than google_ws_state, so an arch/modifier
// mistake here would never show up in the state tests; only a real render catches it.
// The students are archived (that is what opens the grace period) but still show up in
// this list: ems.action_student_kanban deliberately runs with active_test disabled, so
// withdrawn/graduated students remain reachable from their own menu.
