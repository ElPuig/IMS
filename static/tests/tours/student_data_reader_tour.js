// Issue #393. A TransactionCase proves the records are readable; it renders nothing, so it
// cannot catch a screen that filters itself in server-side action code or in an OWL loader -
// exactly the two traps this feature hit (the Students list is an ir.actions.server that
// re-domains itself by role, and the tutor grade matrix filters client-side).
//
// Driven by a guidance user who tutors nobody: every record below belongs to another teacher's
// tutees, so an empty list here is a real failure, not a missing fixture.
