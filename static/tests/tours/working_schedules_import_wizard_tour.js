// ems.working_schedules_import_wizard has no static ir.actions.act_window record - it's only
// ever opened dynamically (doAction() with a plain dict) from the "Working Schedules" list's
// cog menu (static/src/js/backend/import_planner_cog_menu.js, isDisplayed gated on
// actionName === "Working Schedules") or from an employee's own Schedule tab. This tour
// reaches it the same way a real user would: navigate to the list, open the cog menu, click
// "Import: planner data". widget="many2many_binary" (attachment_ids) had zero browser
// coverage. Rather than building a full valid planner XML (a real schedule-entry format, out
// of scope for what this gap is actually about), this exercises a real, simple path: an XML
// naming a teacher e-mail that doesn't exist yet.
//
// Changed 2026-08-05 (developer feedback after actually using the wizard): the intro/welcome
// screen no longer validates or shows anything about the file's own content - not even an
// unknown e-mail - since resolving that is what steps 2-3 exist for (see
// plans/working_schedule_import_redesign.md). "Continue" only ever depends on a file being
// attached at all, so an unknown e-mail here doesn't block leaving the intro screen any more.
//
// Updated again 2026-08-05, once screen 3 ("Resolve teachers") was actually built: an unknown
// e-mail no longer reaches Import at all - it surfaces right here, as an unresolved line on the
// 'teachers' screen, with "Continue" rendering disabled (not hidden - see 'continue_disabled')
// until a real teacher is picked for it. This tour proves it stays blocked when left unresolved;
// see 'ems_working_schedules_import_resolve_teacher_email' below for the full resolve-and-complete
// path (mirroring 'ems_working_schedules_import_resolve_group').

// Renders the "Pending identification" indicator (list badge column, kanban + form ribbon)
// added to views/community/employee/{list,kanban,form}.xml for a teacher created from a
// schedule-import placeholder code. The employee is seeded directly via the ORM in
// TestWorkingSchedulesImportWizardTour.test_employee_pending_identification_indicator_tour -
// this tour is only about proving the VIEW renders correctly, not re-testing the importer
// (covered above and by TestWorkingSchedulesImportWizard's backend tests). The kanban indicator
// used to be a badge under the name; changed to a ribbon (2026-08-01) for visual consistency
// with the "Archived"/reason-aware ribbons added to this same kanban right before it.
