// Issue #416: the Department Chief field (hr.department.manager_id) used to be required at the
// view level (views/community/department/form.xml) for every non-top-level, non-sharing
// department, blocking an admin from ever saving a department with no Chief - which can
// legitimately happen mid course-transition (the outgoing Chief removed before a new one is
// assigned). The model itself already tolerates an empty manager_id
// (hr.department._effective_manager() returns an empty recordset "left for an admin to
// configure"); only the form ever blocked it. This tour proves the form allows it too.
