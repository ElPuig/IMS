// Shared crawler for the per-role smoke tours - see CLAUDE.md's "Per-role smoke tours" (issue
// #434 follow-up). Each role's own tour file (role_smoke_<role>_tour.js) is a thin wrapper
// around crawlAccessibleScreens() below, registered under its own role-specific tour name so
// each lands as its own test class/shard.
//
// Instead of a hand-authored step list, this fetches the exact menu tree the real webclient
// would (already filtered server-side by the logged-in session's own groups, via the "menu"
// service) and opens every reachable window action in every view_mode it declares. It asserts
// nothing about the data shown - only that nothing crashes. Detection needs no bespoke
// error-dialog checking: Odoo's own tour/HttpCase harness already fails the test on any
// console.error, and the webclient's error service logs every uncaught client error that way
// (including an AccessError surfaced while a view fetches its data - exactly how #434 itself
// would have been caught here). `Component.env` (set by web/static/src/start.js on every
// webclient boot) is used instead of a step's own `this` context, which the tour engine binds
// to `{anchor}` only.
//
// Maintaining this list: add an action's xml_id here only for a CONFIRMED false positive - a
// deliberate business-rule guard (typically a UserError raised from default_get()/create() for
// a role that legitimately cannot use that screen), not to silence a genuine finding. xml_id
// (not the numeric action id, which varies per database) is what keeps this list portable
// across environments - see CLAUDE.md's "Per-role smoke tours".

// a genuine "TIMEOUT step failed to complete within 10000 ms" on the secretary role's own spike
// run. 60000 is the actual ceiling: web_tour's own StepSchema (tour_service.js) validates

// never actually cancels the losing side, so the abandoned doAction() call kept mutating the
// action-manager/controller-stack state in the background, corrupting whichever unrelated
// action the crawler had already moved on to (confirmed: several actions immediately after the
// one that "timed out" then failed too, with onWillStart errors that had zero corresponding
// server-side trace - i.e. no real server call ever failed for them). Reverted in favor of
// fixing the actual slow screen instead (see SKIP_ACTION_XMLIDS) - a real await, left to
// complete or genuinely fail on its own, is what keeps one screen's problem from bleeding into
// the next.
