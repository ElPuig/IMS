// that shift, rows are time blocks, plus the guard-duty teacher(s) for each block. A guard slot
// has no group of its own (see resource.calendar.attendance.group_ids' own NOTE on non-teaching
// rows), so guards are reported per-row instead of as one more column.
//
// A plain ir.actions.client (registered below), not a form view on a wizard record — see
// models/attendance/guard_duty_board.py's own class docstring for why: a wizard record's URL
// would show a raw "model/id" instead of a proper "action-<xmlid>" like every other EMS screen.
//
// Data is fetched via RPC, one weekday/shift at a time (ems.course.get_guard_duty_board_data()) —
// not read from any field's own prefetched sub-records, unlike the teacher/group/student grids
// (schedule_grid_field.js/schedule_grid_readonly_field.js). Those aggregate at most one teacher's,
// one group's or one student's own schedule; this one aggregates the whole centre (easily several hundred rows),
// which the web client's own x2many sub-record fetch silently caps — an earlier version that did
// read a prefetched field this way only ever showed real data for whichever weekday loaded first.
