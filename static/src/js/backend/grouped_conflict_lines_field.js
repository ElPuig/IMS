// Groups a conflict-line o2m (internal_conflict_line_ids/external_conflict_line_ids) into cards
// by 'kind', then into sub-sections by 'left_group_key' within each kind - developer feedback
// (2026-08-10) after resolving a large real batch by hand, one row at a time: "me iría bien que
// estuvieran agrupadas por tipo... y por 'left', y que cada grupo me permitiera escoger el
// resolution que se aplica al grupo entero." Each sub-section gets its own bulk-resolution
// dropdown - picking a value there writes it onto every row in that sub-section via
// 'record.update()' (the same client-side model every other field widget already uses, so a
// picked value is immediately visible without any extra RPC), then resets itself so it never
// looks like a bound field - every row's OWN resolution dropdown right below it stays fully
// editable afterward for a one-off override, exactly like the plain list this replaces.
//
// 'left_group_key' (teacher + subject, server-side '_entry_group_key') supersedes 'left_label'
// (teacher + subject + group + weekday + time) as the sub-section KEY, not just its display text -
// developer feedback the same day, after seeing the first version rendered for real: grouping by
// the full label produced one sub-section per row in practice, since two different conflicts
// almost never share the exact same group/weekday/time too, only rarely the same teacher+subject.
// The row itself keeps showing the FULL 'left_label'/'right_label' (never trimmed down to "just
// the diff") since the right side's own teacher/subject can genuinely differ from the left's
// (e.g. a plain room clash between two unrelated classes) - only the grouping key is coarser, not
// what a row displays.
//
// Also developer feedback (2026-08-10, after using the grouped view for real): plain "left"/
// "right" text with no label read as arbitrary - unlike the OLD list's own two dedicated columns
// (labeled "File"/"File" or "File"/"Database" as column HEADERS), a row here has no header of its
// own to carry that meaning. Fixed by never showing the bare words "left"/"right" in the UI at
// all: on "File conflicts" (internal - both sides are file entries, so there is no asymmetry
// worth naming) a row just joins the two full descriptions with "vs."; on "Existing schedule
// conflicts" (external - genuinely asymmetric) each side is explicitly prefixed "New:"/"Old:"
// (renamed 2026-09-06 from "File:"/"Database:" - developer feedback after real testing: the file
// side is what's actually going to be kept, the DB side is what it replaces, so "new"/"old" reads
// more directly than which SOURCE each side came from), in bold, joined by "→" instead of the
// former plain "-" (found unclear the same day: "ese guion chiquito no es claro").
//
// The same asymmetry applies to the room-picker columns (only shown once a row's own resolution
// is 'reassign_rooms'): these had NO header or label at all until 2026-09-06, and a placeholder
// alone would not have fixed it either, since both pickers are pre-filled with the SAME colliding
// room by default (see '_build_external_conflict_lines'/'_build_internal_conflict_lines' server-
// side) - a placeholder never shows once a field already has a value. Fixed with a real, always-
// visible header label per column, once per sub-group (not repeated per row): "New classroom"/
// "Old classroom" for external, "Left"/"Right" for internal - the latter deliberately keeps the
// bare left/right wording here (developer's own call, 2026-09-06: "como son conflictos del
// fichero consigo mismo, usaremos left y right"), unlike the row text above.
//
// The grouping is entirely client-side (kind/left_label are already loaded, ordinary Char/
// Selection values) - no new server method, no extra round-trip. Left/right room pickers (only
// ever relevant once a row's own resolution is 'reassign_rooms') use Odoo's generic 'AutoComplete'
// component directly (the same one the standard Many2one field widget itself is built on) rather
// than the generic per-record 'Field' component: the latter's Many2one only renders as genuinely
// editable once 'record.isInEdition' is true, which a plain o2m load never sets for a row that
// isn't the single "currently edited" row of a real list (confirmed empirically - it rendered as
// inert text, not an editable input, in a real browser) - not worth chasing given every row here
// needs to be directly editable at once, never one-row-at-a-time list editing. 'AutoComplete' has
// no such "is this row in edition" dependency at all - it is a fully self-contained input, driven
// here by a plain 'ems.space' 'name_search' RPC and writing straight onto the record via
// 'record.update()', matching exactly the '[id, display_name]' shape Many2OneField's own
// 'updateRecord()' writes.

    // forma?", tested with an 85-row tour fixture - safely past Odoo's own x2many page-size default
    // of 80): plain 'record.update({ resolution: value })' triggers a genuine server 'onchange' RPC
    // per call ('resolution' is a dependency of the wizard's own invisible 'continue_disabled'
    // field present in the same view, so Odoo's arch-level onchange-spec builder marks it needing a
    // round-trip on every edit, regardless of there being an explicit '@api.onchange') - firing that
    // sequentially for every record in a large sub-group made bulk-apply itself the new bottleneck
    // once the widget's own full-record-load fix stopped hiding rows past that count.
    //
    // Fix: 'Record._update()' (the private method the public 'update()' wraps) accepts
    // 'withoutOnchange'/'withoutParentUpdate' directly - the public wrapper only ever sets the
    // former, and only via a 'save' flag that ALSO force-saves the record early, not something this
    // deferred-write wizard wants. Both flags are needed, not just 'withoutOnchange' alone: a
    // nested record's own 'onUpdate' callback (wired up by 'StaticList._createRecordDatapoint', a
    // SEPARATE mechanism from the line's own field-level onchange) independently notifies the
    // PARENT (wizard) record's own onchange too unless told not to - confirmed by reading that
    // callback directly in 'static_list.js'. Skip both for every record but the last (still applies
    // + re-renders each row's own value locally, and still queues its own write command for the
    // eventual Continue/Import save - 'StaticList' pushes that command before the parent-
    // notification check, so nothing here is lost) - the one real RPC, on the final record, already
    // carries every already-applied sibling change along with it (an x2many sub-record's onchange
    // payload includes its own parent's current full pending state, not just this one row's own
    // delta - confirmed by reading 'Record._getOnchangeValues()'), so 'continue_disabled' still ends
    // up correctly recomputed from the FULL, final state in that single round-trip.
    //
    // A more aggressive follow-up (bypassing '_update()' entirely for non-final records via
    // 'Record._applyChanges()' plus manually replicating its 'dirty'/'_commands' bookkeeping, to
    // additionally batch the 84 local mutations into a single OWL render instead of 84) was tried
    // and REVERTED (2026-08-10) - it introduced a new, unexplained regression where the final
    // record's onchange RPC completed successfully (confirmed in server logs) but the client never
    // reflected the result, with no thrown error to explain why. Reaching that deep into private,
    // undocumented reactivity internals for a scenario this extreme (85 rows resolved in a single
    // click, far past anything a real EMS import is likely to produce) traded a correctness risk
    // for a speed gain in an edge case - not a good trade. This version is the one confirmed
    // correct: still real per-row local re-renders (bounded, not free), but no unexplained failures
    // across repeated runs. Wrapped in the model's own mutex (same serialization the public
    // 'update()' wrapper provides) since this bypasses it to reach these two options directly.
